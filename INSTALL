BIOPERL INSTALLATION

Bioperl has been installed on many forms of Unix,
Win9X/NT/2000/XP, and on Mac OS X (see the PLATFORMS file for more
details). Following are instructions for installing Bioperl for
Unix/Linux/Mac OS X; Windows installation instructions can be found
in INSTALL.WIN. For installing Bioperl for Mac OS X using Fink, see
Getting BioPerl.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

     * Perl 5.6.1 or later; version 5.8 and greater are recommended. Note
       that most modules will work with earlier versions of Perl. The only
       ones that will not are Bio::SimpleAlign and the Bio::Index::*
       modules. If you don't need these modules and you want to install
       Bioperl using an earlier version of Perl, edit the "require 5.005;"
       line in Makefile.PL as necessary.

     * External modules: Bioperl uses functionality provided in other
       Perl modules. Some of these are included in the standard perl package
       but some need to be obtained from the CPAN site. The list of external
       modules is included at the bottom of this document.

The CPAN Bioperl Bundle (Bundle::BioPerl) makes installation of these
external modules easy. Simply install the bundle using your CPAN shell and
all necessary modules will be installed. See THE BIOPERL BUNDLE,
below.

OPTIONAL

   * ANSI C or GNU C compiler (gcc) for XS extensions (the
     bioperl-ext package; see BUILDING THE OPTIONAL bioperl-ext
     PACKAGE, below).

ADDITIONAL INSTALLATION INFORMATION

   * Additional information on Bioperl and MAC OS:
      * OS 9 - http://bioperl.org/Core/mac-bioperl.html
      * OS X - http://www.tc.umn.edu/~cann0010/Bioperl_OSX_install.html
      * OS X - Installing using Fink (in Getting BioPerl)

THE BIOPERL BUNDLE

You typically need root privileges to install using CPAN. If you don't
have these privileges please see INSTALLING BIOPERL IN A PERSONAL
MODULE AREA for additional information.

Install Bundle::Bioperl using CPAN. One way:

 >perl -MCPAN -e "install Bundle::BioPerl"

Another way:

 >perl -MCPAN -e shell
 cpan>install Bundle::BioPerl


INSTALLING BIOPERL THE EASY WAY USING CPAN

You can use the CPAN shell to install Bioperl. For example:

 >perl -MCPAN -e shell

Then find the name of the Bioperl version you want:

 cpan>d /bioperl/
 CPAN: Storable loaded ok
 Going to read /home/bosborne/.cpan/Metadata
 Database was generated on Tue, 24 Feb 2004 23:55:23 GMT
 DistributionB/BI/BIRNEY/bioperl-1.2.tar.gz
 DistributionB/BI/BIRNEY/bioperl-1.4.tar.gz

Now install:

 cpan>install B/BI/BIRNEY/bioperl-1.4.tar.gz

If you've installed everything perfectly and all the network connections
are working then you may pass all the tests run in the 'make test' phase.
It's also possible that you may fail some tests. Possible explanations:
problems with local Perl installation, network problems, previously
undetected bug in Bioperl, flawed test script, problems with CGI
script used for sequence retrieval at public database, and so on. Remember
that there are over 700 modules in Bioperl and the test suite is running
more than 9000 individual tests, a few failed tests may not affect your
usage of Bioperl.

If you decide that the failed tests will not affect how you intend to use
Bioperl and you'd like to install anyway do:

 cpan>force install B/BI/BIRNEY/bioperl-1.4.tar.gz

This is what most experienced Bioperl users would do. However, if you're
concerned about a failed test and need assistance or advice then contact
bioperl-l@bioperl.org.

INSTALLING BIOPERL THE EASY WAY USING GNU 'make'

The advantage of this approach is it's stepwise, so it's easy to stop and
analyze in case of any problem.

Download, then unpack the tar file. For example:

 >gunzip bioperl-1.2.tar.gz
 >tar xvf bioperl-1.2.tar
 >cd bioperl-1.2

Now issue the make commands:

 >perl Makefile.PL
 >make
 >make test

If you've installed everything perfectly and all the network connections
are working then you may pass all the tests run in the 'make test' phase.
It's also possible that you may fail some tests. Possible explanations:
problems with local Perl installation, network problems, previously
undetected bug in Bioperl, flawed test script, problems with CGI script
using for sequence retrieval at public database, and so on. Remember that
there are over 700 modules in Bioperl and the test suite is running almost
9000 individual tests, a few failed tests may not affect your usage of
Bioperl.

If you decide that the failed tests will not affect how you intend to use
Bioperl and you'd like to install anyway do:

 >make install

This is what most experienced Bioperl users would do. However, if you're
concerned about a failed test and need assistance or advice then contact
bioperl-l@bioperl.org.

To 'make install' you need write permission in the perl5/site_perl/source
area. Usually this will require you becoming root, so you will want to
talk to your systems manager if you don't have the necessary privileges.

It is also straightforward to install the package outside of the this
standard Perl5 location. See INSTALLING BIOPERL IN A PERSONAL MODULE
AREA, below.

WHERE ARE THE MAN PAGES?

We had to disable the automatic creation of man pages because this
step was triggering a "line too long" error on some OSs due to shell
constraints. If you'd like to try and create them comment out or delete
the MY::manifypods subroutine in Makefile.PL before you issue the 'perl
Makefile.PL' step.   

EXTERNAL PROGRAMS

Bioperl can interface with some external programs for executing analyses.
These include clustalw and t_coffee for Multiple Sequence Alignment
(Bio::Tools::Run::Alignment::Clustalw and
Bio::Tools::Run::Alignment::TCoffee) and blastall, blastpgp, and
bl2seq for BLAST analyses (Bio::Tools::Run::StandAloneBlast), and
to all the programs in the EMBOSS suite (Bio::Factory::EMBOSS).

    Environment Variables

Some modules which run external programs need certain environment
variables set. If you do not have a local copy of the specific executable
you do not need to set these variables. Additionally the modules will
attempt to locate the specific applications in your runtime PATH variable.
You may also need to set an environment variable to tell BioPerl about
your network configuration if your site uses a firewall.

Setting environment variables on unix means adding lines like the
following to your shell *rc file.

   For bash or sh:

 export BLASTDIR=/data1/blast

   For csh or tcsh:

 setenv BLASTDIR /data1/blast

Some environment variables include:

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Env. Variable |                      Description                       |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
|               |Specifies where the NCBI blastall, blastpgp, bl2seq,    |
|BLASTDIR       |etc.. are located. A 'data' directory could also be     |
|               |present in this directory as well, you could put your   |
|               |blastable databases here.                               |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
|               |If one does not want to locate the data dir within the  |
|BLASTDATADIR or|same dir as where the BLASTDIR variable points, a       |
|BLASTDB        |BLASTDATADIR or BLASTDB variable can be set to point to |
|               |a dir where BLAST database indexes are located.         |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
|BLASTMAT       |The directory containing the substitution matrices such |
|               |as BLOSUM62.                                            |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
|CLUSTALDIR     |The directory where the clustalw executable is located. |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
|TCOFFEEDIR     |The directory where the t_coffee executable is located. |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
|               |If you access the internet via a proxy server then you  |
|               |can tell the Bioperl modules which require network      |
|               |access about this by using the http_proxy environment   |
|http_proxy     |variable. The value set includes the proxy address and  |
|               |the port, with optional username/password for           |
|               |authentication purposes                                 |
|               |(e.g. http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@proxy.example.com:8080). |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

INSTALLING BIOPERL SCRIPTS

Bioperl comes with a set of production-quality scripts that are
kept in the scripts/ directory. You can install these scripts if you'd
like, simply answer the questions on 'make install'. The installation
directory is specified by the INSTALLSCRIPT variable in the Makefile, the
default location is /usr/bin. Installation will copy the scripts to the
specified directory, change the 'PLS' suffix to 'pl', and prepend 'bp_' to
all the script names if they aren't so named already.

INSTALLING BIOPERL IN A PERSONAL MODULE AREA

If you lack permission to install perl modules into the standard
site_perl/ system area you can configure Bioperl to install itself
anywhere you choose. Ideally this would be a personal perl directory or
standard place where you plan to put all your 'local' or personal perl
modules.

Simply pass a parameter to perl as it builds your system specific
makefile.

   Example:

 >perl Makefile.PL  LIB=/home/users/dag/My_Local_Perl_Modules
 >make
 >make test
 >make install

This tells perl to install bioperl in the desired place, e.g.:

   /home/users/dag/My_Local_Perl_Modules/Bio/Seq.pm

Then in your Bioperl script you would write:

 use lib "/home/users/dag/My_Local_Perl_Modules";
 use Bio::Seq;

The man pages will probably be installed in $LIB/man. For more information
on these sorts of custom installs see the documentation for
ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

You can also use CPAN to install accessory modules in your local
directory. First enter the CPAN shell, then set the arguments for the
command "perl Makefile.PL", like this:

 >perl -e shell -MCPAN
 cpan>o conf makepl_arg LIB=/home/users/dag/My_Local_Perl_Modules

INSTALLING BIOPERL MODULES THE HARD WAY

As a last resort, you can simply copy all files in Bio/ to any directory
in which you have write privileges. This is generally NOT recommended
since some modules may require special configuration (currently none do,
but don't rely on this).

You will need to set "use lib '/path/to/my/bioperl/modules';" in your perl
scripts so that you can access these modules if they are not installed in
the standard site_perl/ location. See above for an example.

To get manpage documentation to work correctly you will have to
configure man so that it looks in the proper directory. On most systems
this will just involve adding an additional directory to your $MANPATH
environment variable.

The installation of the Compile directory can be similarly redirected, but
execute the make commands from the Compile/SW directory.

If all else fails or are unable to access the perl distribution
directories, ask your system administrator to place the files there for
you. You can always execute perl scripts in the same directory as the
location of the modules (Bio/ in the distribution) since perl always
checks the current working directory when looking for modules.

USING MODULES NOT INSTALLED IN THE STANDARD LOCATION

You can explicitly tell perl where to look for modules by using the
Lib module which comes standard with perl.

   Example:

 #!/usr/bin/perl
 use lib "/home/users/dag/My_Local_Perl_Modules/";
 use Bio::Seq;
 #<...insert whizzy perl code here...>

Or, you can set the environmental variable PERL5LIB:

   csh or tcsh:

 setenv PERL5LIB /home/users/dag/My_Local_Perl_Modules/

   bash or sh:

 export PERL5LIB=/home/users/dag/My_Local_Perl_Modules/

THE TEST SYSTEM

The Bioperl test system is located in the t/ directory and is
automatically run whenever you execute the 'make test' command.
Alternatively if you want to investigate the behavior of a specific test
such as the SeqIO test you would type:

 >perl -I. -w t/SeqIO.t

The -I. tells Perl to use the current directory as the include path - this
makes sure you are testing the modules in this directory not ones
installed elsewhere in your PERL5LIB path. The -w tells Perl to print all
warnings.

If you are trying to learn how to use a module, often the test suite is a
good place to look. All good extreme programmers try and write a test
BEFORE they write the module to insure that their module behaves the way
they expect. You'll notice some 'ok' and 'skip' commands in a test, this
is part of the Perl test suite that signifies a passed test with an 'ok
N', where N is the test number. Alternatively you can tell Perl to skip
tests. This is useful when, for example, your test detects that the
network is not present and thus should skip, not fail, any tests that
require a network connection.

BUILDING THE OPTIONAL bioperl-ext PACKAGE

The bioperl-ext package contains C code and XS extensions for
various alignment and trace file modules (Bio::Tools::pSW for DNA
Smith-Waterman, Bio::Tools::dpAlign for protein Smith-Waterman,
Bio::SearchDist for EVD fitting of extreme value,
Bio::SeqIO::staden).

This Installation works out-of-the box for all platforms except BSD
and Solaris boxes. For other platforms skip this next paragraph.

    CONFIGURING for BSD and Solaris boxes

You should add the line -fPIC to the CFLAGS line in
Compile/SW/libs/makefile. This makes the compile generate position
independent code, which is required for these architectures. In addition,
on some Solaris boxes, the generated Makefile does not make the correct
-fPIC/-fpic flags for the C compiler that is used. This requires manual
editing of the generated Makefile to switch case. Try it out once, and if
you get errors, try editing the -fpic line

    INSTALLATION

Move to the directory bioperl-ext. This is available as a separate package
released from ftp://bioperl.org/pub/bioperl/DIST. This is where the C
code and XS extension for the bp_sw module is held and execute these
commands: (possibly after making the change for BSD and Solaris, as
detailed above)

 perl Makefile.PL   # makes the system specific makefile
 make          # builds all the libaries
 make test     # runs a short test
 make install  # installs the package correctly.

This should install the compiled extension. The Bio::Tools::pSW
module will work cleanly now.

DEPENDENCIES AND Bundle::BioPerl

The following packages are used by Bioperl. Not all are required for
Bioperl to operate properly, however some functionality will be missing
without them. You can easily install all of these, except srsperl.pm,
using the Bundle::BioPerl CPAN bundle.

The DBD::mysql, DB_File and XML::Parser modules require other applications
or databases: MySQL, Berkeley DB, and expat respectively.

Notes

    1. Available at http://stein.cshl.org 
    2. Requires expat, at http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/
    3. Requires MySQL, from http://www.mysql.org 
    4. Requires GD library (libgd) from http://www.boutell.com/gd 
    5. Installing the GD library - libgd - is somewhat non-trivial since
       there are a number of dependencies to consider. Matias Giovannini has
       posted an excellent walkthrough for Mac OS X 10.4. 
    6. Requires Berkeley DB, from Linux RPM or from
       http://www.sleepycat.com 
    7. These modules may be present in older distributions but are considered
       redundant; use Bio::SeqIO::chadoxml instead. 
    8. Bio::Graph::SimpleGraph requires Class::AutoClass v. 1.01;
       earlier versions give very different results. 
    9. This module is optional but recommended for speeding up parsing over
       the default XML::SAX::PurePerl. If installed, XML::SAX::Expat currently
       does not work correctly due to DTD problems.
