=head1 NAME

Bioperl - Coordinated OOP-Perl Modules for Biology

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Not very appropriate to put a synopsis  - many
different objects to use. Read on...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Bioperl contains a number of Perl objects which are useful in biology.
Examples include Sequence objects, Alignment objects and database
searching objects. These objects not only do what they are advertised
to do in the documentation, but they also interact - Alignment
objects are made from the Sequence objects and so on. This means that
the objects provide a coordinated framework to do computational
biology.

If you are new to bioperl, reading biostart.pod will get you aquainted
with writing scripts and the main players for the objects.


Bioperl development is focused on the objects themselves, and less on the 
scripts (programs) that put these objects together. There are some example
scripts provided in the distribution, but it is not the focus of the
objects that are distributed. Of course, as the objects do most of the
hardwork for you, all you have to do is combine a number of objects
together sensibly.

The intent of the bioperl development effort is to make reusable tools
that aid people in creating their own site or job specific applications.

The bio.perl.org (http://bio.perl.org) website also attempts to maintain 
links and archives of standalone bio-related perl tools that are not
affiliated or related to the core bioperl effort. Check the site for
useful code ideas and contribute your own if possible.


=head1 INSTALLATION

The Bioperl modules are distributed as a tar file that expands into a
standard perl CPAN distribution.  Detailed installation directions 
can be found in the distribution README file.

The Bioperl modules can now interact with local flat file databases.
To learn how to set this up, look at the bioback.pod documentation
(perldoc bioback will work once it has been installed. Alternatively
go perldoc bioback.pod directly).

=head1 GETTING STARTED

The directory scripts/ have fully working, industrial strength scripts
for use with bioperl. These are documented (perldoc <scriptname> will
work). This area only started in the 0.05 distribution, and so not
that many scripts have been written (you are more than welcome to
contribute!)

The example scripts in the distribution I<examples/> directory and sub
directories therein give you an idea of how to use some of the modules
and driver code.

If you have installed bioperl in the standard way, as said in the
README in the distribution these examples should work by just running
them. If you have a not installed it in a standard way you will
have to change the 'use lib' to point to your installation.


I<examples/rev_and_trans.pl> - examples using Bio::Seq.pm for reversing and translating sequences

I<examples/restriction.pl> - example code for using the Bio::Tools::RestrictionEnzyme.pm module.

I<examples/simplealign.pl> - example code for using the Bio::SimpleAlign module.

I<examples/psw.pl> - example code for using the XS extensions for a Protein Smith-Waterman comparison.

I<examples/blast/> - example code for using the Bio::Tools::Blast.pm module.

I<examples/seq/> - example code for working with multiple sequence files.

I<examples/root_object/> - example code for using Bio::Root::Object.pm.


=head1 OBJECTS


=head2 Sequence objects

I<Bio::Seq> Sequence object

This module is the generic sequence object which lies at
the core of the bioperl project. It stores DNA, RNA, or
amino acid sequence information and brief annotation. It has
associated methods to perform various manipulations of
sequences and support for a reading and writing sequence
data in a variety of file formats.

Seq.pm has its own detailed documentation.

=head2 Blast objects

I<Bio::Tools::Blast>

The Bio::Tools::Blast.pm module encapsulates data and
methods for running, parsing, and analyzing pre-existing
BLAST reports. 

Blast.pm and all associated helper modules all have
their own detailed documentation.

FEATURES:

       o Supports NCBI Blast1.x, Blast2.x, and WashU-Blast2.x,
         gapped and ungapped. Can parse HTML-formatted as well 
         as non-HTML-formatted reports.

       o Launch new Blast analyses remotely or locally.
         Blast objects can be constructed directly from the
         results of the run.  (Support for local Blasts 
         is not yet complete.)

       o Construct Blast objects from pre-existing files or from
         a new run.
         Build a Blast object from a single file or build
         multiple Blast objects from an input stream containing
         multiple reports. 

       o Add hypertext links from a BLAST report.

       o Generate sequence and sequence alignment objects from
         HSP sequences.


=head2 Restriction Enzyme objects

I<Bio::Tools::RestrictionEnzyme>

The Bio::Tools::RestrictionEnzyme.pm module encapsulates
generic data and methods for using restriction
endonucleases for in silico restriction analysis of DNA
sequences.

RestrictionEnzyme.pm has its own detailed documentation.

=head2 Protein Smith-Waterman alignment objects

I<Bio::Tools::pSW>

This module allows the production of Smith Waterman alignments. 
I<Warning> it requires a compiled-C extension (bp_sw) which is
provided in the distribution. The Bio::Tools::pSW object is 
an object factory which builds Bio::SimpleAlign objects from
two protein sequences objects (Bio::Seq).

DNA alignments will be added soon.

=head2 SimpleAlign objects

I<Bio::SimpleAlign>

Bio::SimpleAlign encapsulates multiple alignments as simple blocks of
immutable sequences. This modules provides principly I/O of multiple
alignments and some easy ways to iterate over an alignment

It is not capable of complex join or editing functions, which is
better provided by Georg Fuellen's UnivAln module. Nor does it
I<make> alignments, which must be done by external programs or, for
pairwise alignments, the Bio::Tools::pSW module

=head2 Other Modules

(** to be completed **)

=head2 Using the Bio::Root modules with your own perl5 classes

The example directory in the bioperl distribution I<examples/root_object/> 
contains code and scripts that show how the Bio::Root modules can be used 
as a foundation for robust and fault tolerant perl5 classes.

=head1 GETTING INVOLVED

Bioperl is a completely open community of developers. We are not
funded and we don't have a mission statement. We encourage
collaborative code, in particular in perl. You can help us in many
different ways, from just a simple statement about how you have used
bioperl to do something interesting to contributing a whole new object
heirarchy. See http://bio.perl.org for more information. Here are
some ways of helping us

=head2 Telling us you used it

We are very interested to hear how you experienced using bioperl. Did
it install cleanly? Did you understand the documentation? Could you
get the objects to do what you wanted it to do? If bioperl was useless
we want to know why, and if it was great - that too. Post a message to
vsns-bcd-perl-guts@lists.uni-bielefeld.de (the bioperl 'guts' mailing
list, where all the developers are).

Only by getting people's feedback do we know whether we are providing
anything useful.

=head2 Writing a script that uses it

By writing a good script that uses bioperl you both show that bioperl
is useful and probably save someone elsewhere writing it. If you
contribute it to the 'script central' at http://bio.perl.org then other
people can view and use it

=head2 Find bugs!

We know that there are bugs in there. If you find something which you are
pretty sure is a problem, post a note to bioperl-bugs@bio.perl.org and
we will get on it as soon as possible. (you can also access the bug
system through the web pages).

=head2 Suggest new functionality

You can suggest areas where the objects are not ideally written and
could be done better. The best way is to find the main developer
of the module (each module was written principly by one person
except for Seq.pm). Talk to him or her and suggest changes.

=head2 Make your own objects

If you can make a useful object we will happily include it into the
core. Probably you will want to read alot of the documentation 
in the Bio::Root section and also talk to people on the 'guts'
mailing list vsns-bcd-perl-guts@lists.uni-bielefeld.de

biodesign.pod provides documentation on the conventions and ideas
used in bioperl. It is definitely worth a ready if you are interested
in contributing.

=head1 CONVENTIONS

=head2 Alphabets

Bioperl modules use the standard extended single-letter genetic
alphabets to represent nucleotide and amino acid sequences.

In addition to the standard alphabet, the following symbols
are also acceptable in a biosequence:

 ?  (a missing nucleotide or amino acid)
 -  (gap in sequence)

=head2 Extended Dna / Rna alphabet

 (includes symbols for nucleotide ambiguity)

=head1 TODO

There are many many aspects of bioperl that are being worked on or
should be worked on. Below lists a non exhaustive set: it is very likely
by the time you read this document that some of these things have been
done already, so check out http://bio.perl.org for more details.
Some modules have their own TODO section, which will contain module-
specific action items.

=over

=item Documentation clean-up

'Meta' documentation is still spread around the different objects
rather than in here


=item Bio::Structure

A number of people have been talking about a Structure object
(probably an object heirarchy). See http://bio.perl.org/Projects/Structure
for the current state-of-affairs in this area and to learn how
to get involved.



=item Perl version support

All modules included in the intial Bioperl distribution support 5.003 and
higher. At some point we will begin adding features and modules that require
later versions of perl. Individual modules perhaps should explicitly impose 
their own perl version requirements. Consider this issue open for discussion
on the guts (developer) mailing list.

=back

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Bioperl owes its early organizational support to its association with
the award-winning VSNS-BCD BioComputing Courses; some students of the
1996 course (Chris Dagdigian, Richard Resnick, Lew Gramer, Alessandro
Guffanti, and others) have contributed code and commentary. Georg
Fuellen, the VSNS-BCD chief organizer is one of the driving forces
behind bioperl. Steve Brenner, who was an early adopter of Perl for
bioinformatics provided some of the early work on bioperl.

Bioperl was then taken up by people developing code at the large
genome centres. In particular at Stanford, Steve Chervitz (the current
bioperl coordinator), at the Genome Sequencing Centre (St Louis) Ian
Korf and at the Sanger Centre (Cambridge UK) Ewan Birney.  All of the
C code XS extensions were provided by Ewan Birney. Bioperl is used in
anger at these sites, indicating that is both useful and that it
works.

Uni-bielefeld provides us with our Mailing lists.

Jon Orwant at The Perl Journal (http://www.tpj.com) gave us permission to reprint 
Lincoln Stein's great article on our website. He also worked with the Perl Institute 
(http://www.perl.org) to arrange our perl.org DNS entry. 

Hardware for bio.perl.org was donated by Compaq.

Institute (http://www.genetics.com).
