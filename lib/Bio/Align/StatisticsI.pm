User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to

=head2 distance

 Title   : distance
 Usage   : my $distance_mat = $stats->distance(-align  => $aln, 
		 			       -method => $method);
 Function: Calculates a distance matrix for all pairwise distances of
           sequences in an alignment.
 Returns : Array ref
 Args    : -align  => Bio::Align::AlignI object
           -method => String specifying specific distance method 
                      (implementing class may assume a default)

   my ($self,@args) = @_;
   $self->throw_not_implemented();
}

=head2 available_distance_methods

 Title   : available_distance_methods
 Usage   : my @methods = $stats->available_distance_methods();
 Function: Enumerates the possible distance methods
 Returns : Array of strings
 Args    : none
