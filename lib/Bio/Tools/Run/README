 This directory is now mainly in bioperl-run package
which you should install alongside Bioperl to get over
50 different runnable options. We might decide to merge
the two packages again, but the feeling is that bioperl
"core" is getting a little too big.

 Bioperl-run follows the same release tagging schedule
as Bioperl. Pick it up from www.bioperl.org and/or CPAN
