=head1 NAME

Bio::Factory::LocationFactoryI - A factory interface for generating locations from a string

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Do not use directly, see Bio::Factory::LocationFactory for example
 use Bio::Factory::FTLocationFactory;
 my $locfact = Bio::Factory::FTLocationFactory->new();
 my $location = $locfact->from_string("1..200");
 print $location->start(), " ", $location->end(), " ", $location->strand,"\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An interface for Location Factories which generate Bio::LocationI
objects from a string.

=head2 from_string

 Title   : from_string
 Usage   : $loc = $locfactory->from_string("100..200");
 Function: Parses the given string and returns a Bio::LocationI implementing
           object representing the location encoded by the string.

           Different implementations may support different encodings. An
           example of a commonly used encoding is the Genbank feature table
           encoding of locations.
 Example :
 Returns : A Bio::LocationI implementing object.
 Args    : A string.

    my ($self,@args) = @_;

    $self->throw_not_implemented();
