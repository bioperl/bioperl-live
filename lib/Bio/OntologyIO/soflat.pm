=head1 NAME

Bio::OntologyIO::soflat - a parser for the Sequence Ontology flat-file format

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::OntologyIO;

  # do not use directly -- use via Bio::OntologyIO
  my $parser = Bio::OntologyIO->new
	( -format       => "so", # or soflat
     -defs_file    => "/home/czmasek/SO/SO.defs",
	  -file         => "/home/czmasek/SO/sofa.ontology" );

  my $sofa_ontology = $parser->next_ontology();

  my $IS_A    = Bio::Ontology::RelationshipType->get_instance( "IS_A" );
  my $PART_OF = Bio::Ontology::RelationshipType->get_instance( "PART_OF" );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Needs Graph.pm from CPAN.

This is essentially a very thin derivation of the dagflat base-parser.

=head1 FEEDBACK

=head2 Mailing Lists

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to the 
Bioperl mailing lists  Your participation is much appreciated.

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.

=head2 new

 Title   : new
 Usage   : $parser = Bio::OntologyIO->new(
                             -format => "soflat",
                             -files => ["/path/to/sofa.ontology"] );
 Function: Creates a new soflat parser.
 Returns : A new soflat parser object, implementing Bio::OntologyIO.
 Args    : -defs_file  => the name of the file holding the term
                          definitions
           -files      => a single ontology flat file holding the
                          term relationships, or an array ref holding
                          the file names
           -file       => if there is only a single flat file, it may
                          also be specified via the -file parameter
           -ontology_name => the name of the ontology; if not specified the
                          parser will auto-discover it by using the term
                          that starts with a $, and converting underscores
                          to spaces
           -engine     => the Bio::Ontology::OntologyEngineI object
                          to be reused (will be created otherwise); note
                          that every Bio::Ontology::OntologyI will
                          qualify as well since that one inherits from the
                          former.

See L<Bio::Ontology::OntologyI>.
