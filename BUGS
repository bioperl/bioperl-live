Known Bugs 


Bioperl 0.7.1
=============
 * Bio::Tools::BPlite does not parse and set frame properly for
   tblastx reports (Jitterbug bug # 978).

 * Bio::Tools::BPlite interface needs to be updated to fix parsing
   more than bl2seq report report (Jitterbug bug #940), this has been
   fixed on the main code trunk and will be part of the next major
   bioperl release.

 * If File::Temp is not installed, tempdirs are not cleaned up
   properly.  This is fixed on main code trunk with the introduction
   of rmtree method in Bio::Root::IO, however, it is best to install
   File::Temp when running 0.7 branch code.

 * Bio::Tools::Blast does not allow users to run blast, instead us
   Bio::Tools::Run::StandAloneBlast to run local blasts.  To submit
   jobs to a remote blast server like NCBI a module
   Bio::Tools::Run::RemoteBlast has been written but is part of the
   main trunk code and must be obtained through CVS until the next
   major bioperl release.
