---------------------------------------------------------

1.6.901 May 18, 2011

    [Notes]

    * Use of AcePerl is deprecated; Ace.pm isn't actively maintained, and
      modules using Ace will also be deprecated [lds, cjfields]
    * Minor bug fix release
    * Bio::SeqIO::gbxml tests require XML::SAX [hartzell]
    * Address Build.PL issues when DBI is not present [hartzell]
    * Skip gbxml.t and Interpro tests when modules not installed [cjfields]
    * Remove deprecated code for perl 5.14.0 compat [cjfields]
    * Due to schema changes and lack of support for older versions, support
      for NeXML 0.9 is only (very) partially implemented.
      See: https://redmine.open-bio.org/issues/3207

    [Bug fixes]

    * [3205] - small fix to Bio::Perl blast_sequence() to make compliant with
      docs [genehack, cjfields]
    * $VERSION for CPAN/cpanm-based installs was broken; force setting of
      module version from dist_version (probably not the best way to do this,
      but it seems to work) [rbuels, cjfields]


1.6.900 April 14, 201

    [Notes]

    * This will probably be the last release to add significant features to
      core modules; subsequent releases will be for bug fixes alone.
      We are planning on a restructuring of core for summer 2011, potentially
      as part of the Google Summer of Code.  This may become BioPerl 2.0.
    * Version bump represents 'just prior to v 1.7'.  We may have point
      releases to deal with bugs, with increments of 1.6.901, 1.6.902, etc.
      This code essentially is what is on the github master branch.

        - new template for Komodo text editor [cjfields]

1.6.0 Winter 2009
    * Feature/Annotation rollback
        - Problematic changes introduced prior to the 1.5 release have been
          rolled back. These changes led to subtle bugs involving operator
          overloading and interface methods.
        - Behavior is very similar to that for BioPerl 1.4, with tag values
          being stored generically as simple scalars. Results in a modest
          speedup.
    * Bio::Graphics
        - Split into a separate distribution on CPAN, primarily so development
          isn't reliant on a complete BioPerl release.
        - Bio::Graphics::Pictogram has been renamed to Bio::Draw::Pictogram but
          is only available via Subversion (via bioperl-live main trunk)
    * Bio::Root::Test
        - Common test bed for all BioPerl modules
    * Bio::Root::Build
        - Common Module::Build-based subclass for all BioPerl modules
    * Bio::DB::EUtilities
        - Complete refactoring to split up parsing (Bio::Tools::EUtilities),
          parameter handling (Bio::Tools::EUtilities::EUtilParameters),
          and user agent request posting and retrieval
    * Test implementation and reorganization
        - Tests have been reorganized into groups based on classes or use
          cases.
        - Automated test coverage is now online:
          http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Test_Coverage
        - After this release, untested modules will be moved into a
          separate developer distribution until tests can be derived.
          Also, new modules to be added are expected to have a test suite
          and adequate test coverage.

    The following represents a brief overview of the most important changes.

    o Bio::Map
      - Overhaul. Brand new system fully allows markers to have multiple
        positions on multiple maps, and to have relative positions. Should be
        backward compatible.

    o Bio::Taxonomy
      - This module and all the modules in the Taxonomy directory now
        deprecated in favour of Bio::Taxon and Bio::Tree::Tree

    o Bio::DB::Taxonomy

      - Taxonomy.pm
        * get_Taxonomy_Node() eventually to be deprecated, renamed get_taxon().

        * New methods ancestor(), each_Descendent() and _handle_internal_id().

        * Allows for different database modules to create Bio::Taxon objects
          with the same internal id when the same taxon is requested from each.

      - flatfile.pm
        * get_Children_Taxids() is deprecated, superceded by each_Descendent().

        * No longer includes the fake root node 'root'; there are multiple roots
          now (10239, 12884, 12908, 29384 and 131567). Consistent with entrez.pm

      - entrez.pm
        * get_node() has new option -full

        * Caches data retrieved from website

    o Bio::Species
      - Now a Bio::Taxon. Carries out the species name -> specific name munging
        that Bio::DB::Taxonomy modules and SeqIO modules used to do, for
        backward compatability in species() method.

    o Bio::Search and Bio::SearchIO
      - Overhaul. The existing system has been sped up via some minor changes
        (mostly gain-of-function to the API). Bio::PullParserI is introduced
        as a potential eventual replacment for the existing system, though as
        yet only a Hmmpfam parser exists written using it.


1.5.1 Developer release

    o Major problem with how Annotations were written out with
      Bio::Seq is fixed by reverting to old behavior for
      Bio::Annotation objects.

    o Bio::SeqIO

     - genbank.pm
       * bug #1871; REFLOOP' parsing loop, I changed the pattern to
         expect at l east 9 spaces at the beginning of a line to
         indicate line wrapping.

       * Treat multi-line SOURCE sections correctly, this defect broke
         both common_name() and classification()

       * parse swissprot fields in genpept file

       * parse WGS genbank records

     - embl.pm
        * Changed regexp for ID line. The capturing parentheses are
          the same, the difference is an optional repeated-not-semi-
          colon expression following the captured \S+. This means the
          regexp works when the division looks like /PRO;/ or when the
          division looks like /ANG ;/ - the latter is from EMBL
          repbase

        * fix ID line parsing: the molecule string can have spaces in
          it. Like: "genomic DNA"

     - swiss.pm: bugs  #1727, #1734

     - entrezgene.pm
        * Added parser for entrezgene ASN1 (text format) files.
          Uses Bio::ASN1::EntrezGene as a low level parser (get it from CPAN)

    o Bio::AlignIO

     -  maf.pm coordinate problem fixed

    o Bio::Taxonomy and Bio::DB::Taxonomy

     - Parse NCBI XML now so that nearly all the taxonomy up-and-down
       can be done via Web without downloading all the sequence.

    o Bio::Tools::Run::RemoteBlast supports more options and complies
      to changes to the NCBI interface. It is reccomended that you
      retrieve the data in XML instead of plain-text BLAST report to
      insure proper parsing and retrieval of all information as NCBI
      fully expects to change things in the future.

    o Bio::Tree and Bio::TreeIO

      - Fixes so that re-rooting a tree works properly

      - Writing out nhx format from a newick/nexus file will properly output
        bootstrap information.  The use must move the internal node labels over
        to bootstraps.
         for my $node ( grep { ! $_->is_Leaf } $tree->get_nodes ) {
            $node->bootstrap($node->id);
	    $node->id('');
	 }
      - Nexus parsing is much more flexible now, does not care about
        LF.

      - Cladogram drawing module in Bio::Tree::Draw

      - Node height and depth now properly calculated

      - fix tree pruning algorithm so that node with 1 child gets merged

    o Graphics tweaks.  Glyph::xyplot improved.  Many other small-medium sized
      bugs and improvements were added, see Gbrowse mailing list for most of
      these.

    o Bio::DB::GFF partially supports GFF3.  See information about
      gff3_munge flag in scripts/Bio-DB-GFF/bulk_load_gff.pl.

    o Better location parsing in Bio::Factory::FTLocationFactory -
      this is part of the engine for parsing EMBL/GenBank feature table
      locations.  Nested join/order-by/complement are allowed now

    o Bio::PrimarySeqI->translate now takes named parameters

    o Bio::Tools::Phylo::PAML - parsing RST (ancestral sequence
      reconstruction) is now supported.  Parsing different models and
      branch specific parametes are now supported.

    o Bio::Factory::FTLocationFactory - parse hierarchical locations
      (joins of joins)

    o Bio::Matrix::DistanceMatrix returns arrayrefs instead of arrays
      for getter/setter functions

    o Bio::SearchIO

      - blast bug #1739; match scientific notation in score
        and possible e+ values

      - blast.pm reads more WU-BLAST parameters and parameters, match
        a full database pathname,

      - Handle NCBI WEB and newer BLAST formats specifically
        (Query|Sbjct:) match in alignment blocks can now be (Query|Sbjct).

      - psl off-by-one error fixed

      - exonerate parsing much improved, CIGAR and VULGAR can be parsed
        and HSPs can be constructed from them.

      - HSPs query/hit now have a seqdesc field filled out (this was
        always available via $hit->description and
        $result->query_description

      - hmmer.pm can parse -A0 hmmpfam files

      - Writer::GbrowseGFF more customizeable.

    o Bio::Tools::Hmmpfam
      make e-value default score displayed in gff, rather than raw score
      allow parse of multiple records


1.5 Developer release

    o Bio::Align::DNAStatistics and Bio::Align::ProteinStatistics
      provide Jukes-Cantor and Kimura pairwise distance methods,
      respectively.

    o Bio::AlignIO support for "po" format of POA, and "maf";
      Bio::AlignIO::largemultifasta is a new alternative to
      Bio::AlignIO::fasta for temporary file-based manipulation of
      particularly large multiple sequence alignments.

    o Bio::Assembly::Singlet allows orphan, unassembled sequences to
      be treated similarly as an assembled contig.

    o Bio::CodonUsage provides new rare_codon() and probable_codons()
      methods for identifying particular codons that encode a given
      amino acid.

    o Bio::Coordinate::Utils provides new from_align() method to build
      a Bio::Coordinate pair directly from a
      Bio::Align::AlignI-conforming object.

    o Bio::DB::Biblio::eutils is a class for querying NCBI's Eutils.
      Send a Pubmed, Pubmed Central, Entrez, or other query to NCBI's
      web service using standard Pubmed query syntax, and retrieve
      results as XML.

    o Bio::DB::GFF has various sundry bug fixes.

    o Bio::FeatureIO is a new SeqIO-style subsystem for
      writing/reading genomic features to/from files.  I/O classes
      exist for BED, GTF (aka GFF v2.5), and GFF v3.  Bio::FeatureIO
      classes only read/write Bio::SeqFeature::Annotated objects.
      Notably, the GFF v3 class requires features to be typed into the
      Sequence Ontology.

    o Bio::Graph namespace contains new modules for manipulation and
      analysis of protein interaction graphs.

    o Bio::Graphics has many bug fixes and shiny new glyphs.

    o Bio::Index::Hmmer and Bio::Index::Qual provide multiple-file
      indexing for HMMER reports and FASTA qual files, respectively.

    o Bio::Map::Clone, Bio::Map::Contig, and Bio::Map::FPCMarker are
      new objects that can be placed within a Bio::Map::MapI-compliant
      genetic/physical map; Bio::Map::Physical provides a new physical
      map type; Bio::MapIO::fpc provides finger-printed clone mapping
      import.

    o Bio::Matrix::PSM provide new support for postion-specific
      (scoring) matrices (e.g. profiles, or "possums").

    o Bio::Ontology::Ontology and Bio::Ontology::Term objects can now
      be instantiated without explicitly using Bio::OntologyIO.  This
      is possible through changes to Bio::Ontology::OntologyStore to
      download ontology files from the web as necessary.  Locations of
      ontology files are hard-coded into
      Bio::Ontology::DocumentRegistry.

    o Bio::PopGen includes many new methods and data types for
      population genetics analyses.

    o New constructor to Bio::Range, unions().  Given a list of
      ranges, returns another list of "flattened" ranges --
      overlapping ranges are merged into a single range with the
      mininum and maximum coordinates of the entire overlapping group.

    o Bio::Root::IO now supports -url, in addition to -file and -fh.
      The new -url argument allows one to specify the network address
      of a file for input.  -url currently only works for GET
      requests, and thus is read-only.

    o Bio::SearchIO::hmmer now returns individual Hit objects for each
      domain alignment (thus containing only one HSP); previously
      separate alignments would be merged into one hit if the domain
      involved in the alignments was the same, but this only worked
      when the repeated domain occured without interruption by any
      other domain, leading to a confusing mixture of Hit and HSP
      objects.

    o Bio::Search::Result::ResultI-compliant report objects now
      implement the "get_statistics" method to access
      Bio::Search::StatisticsI objects that encapsulate any
      statistical parameters associated with the search (e.g. Karlin's
      lambda for BLAST/FASTA).

    o Bio::Seq::LargeLocatableSeq combines the functionality already
      found in Bio::Seq::LargeSeq and Bio::LocatableSeq.

    o Bio::SeqFeature::Annotated is a replacement for
      Bio::SeqFeature::Generic.  It breaks compliance with the
      Bio::SeqFeatureI interface because the author was sick of
      dealing with untyped annotation tags.  All
      Bio::SeqFeature::Annotated annotations are Bio::AnnotationI
      compliant, and accessible through Bio::Annotation::Collection.

    o Bio::SeqFeature::Primer implements a Tm() method for primer
      melting point predictions.

    o Bio::SeqIO now supports AGAVE, BSML (via SAX), CHAOS-XML,
      InterProScan-XML, TIGR-XML, and NCBI TinySeq formats.

    o Bio::Taxonomy::Node now implements the methods necessary for
      Bio::Species interoperability.

    o Bio::Tools::CodonTable has new reverse_translate_all() and
      make_iupac_string() methods.

    o Bio::Tools::dpAlign now provides sequence profile alignments.

    o Bio::Tools::GFF now parses GFF version 2.5 (a.k.a. GTF).

    o Bio::Tools::Fgenesh, Bio::Tools::tRNAscanSE are new report
      parsers.

    o Bio::Tools::SiRNA includes two new rulesets (Saigo and Tuschl)
      for designing small inhibitory RNA.

    o Bio::Tree::DistanceFactory provides NJ and UPGMA tree-building
      methods based on a distance matrix.

    o Bio::Tree::Statistics provides an assess_bootstrap() method to
      calculate bootstrap support values on a guide tree topology,
      based on provided bootstrap tree topologies.

    o Bio::TreeIO now supports the Pagel (PAG) tree format.

1.4 branch

1.4.1

  o Improvements to Bio::AlignIO::nexus for parsing TreeBase nexus files

  o Bio::Graphics will work with gd1 or gd2

  o Bio::SearchIO
   - hmmer.pm Better hmmpfam parsing, fix bug for small number of alignment outputs
     (RF lines alone)
   - blast.pm Parse multi-line query fields properly
   - small speed improvements to blasttable.pm and others

  o Bio::DB::Taxonomy has better support for hierarchy traversal so that
    Bio::Taxonomy::Node can be as simple as Bio::Species object while still
    supporting more complex queries

       Bio::PopGen::PopStats. Calculating composite linkage
       disequilibrium (LD) is available in Bio::PopGen::Statistics as
       well.
     - Bio::PopGen::IO for reading in prettybase (SeattleSNPs)
       and csv (comma delimited formatted) data.

     - a directory for implementing population simulations has
       been added Bio::PopGen::Simulation and 2 simulations - a
       Coalescent and a simple single-locus multi-allele genetic drift
       simulation have been provided.  This replaces the code in

        matrix data.  Matrix::IO::scoring and Matrix::IO::phylip are
        initial implementations for parsing BLOSUM/PAM and Phylip
        Distance matricies respectively.  A generic matrix
        implementation for general use was added in
        Bio::Matrix::Generic.

   o Bio::Tree::AlleleNode has been updated to be a container of
     an Bio::PopGen::Individual object for use in the Coalescent simulations.


1.2 Branch

1.2.3 Stable release update
    o Bug #1475 - Fix and add speedup to spliced_seq for remote location
                  handling.
    o Bug #1477 - Sel --> Sec abbreviation fixed
    o Fix bug #1487 where paring in-between locations when
      end < start caused the FTLocationFactory logic to fail.
    o Fix bug #1489 which was not dealing with keywords as an
      arrayref properly (this is fixed on the main trunk because
      keywords returns a string and the array is accessible via
      get_keywords).
    o Bio::Tree::Tree memory leak (bug #1480) fixed
      Added a new initialization option -nodelete which
      won't try and cleanup the containing nodes if this
      is true.
     o Bug with parsing labeled nodes with Bio::TreeIO::newick fixed
       this was only present on the branch for the 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 series
       - Also merged main trunk changes to the branch which make
         newick -> nhx round tripping more effective (storing branch length
         and bootstrap values in same locate for NodeNHX and Node
         implementations.)  Fixes to TreeIO parsing for labeled internal
         also required small changes to TreeIO::nhx.  Improved
         tests for this module as well.
    o Bio::SearchIO
      - Fixed bugs in BLAST parsing which couldn't parse NCBI
        gapped blast properly (was losing hit significance values due to
        the extra unexpeted column).
      - Parsing of blastcl3 (netblast from NCBI) now can handle case of
        integer overflow (# of letters in nt seq dbs is > MAX_INT)
        although doesn't try to correct it - will get the negative
        number for you.  Added a test for this as well.
      - Fixed HMMER parsing bug which prevented parsing when a hmmpfam report
        has no top-level family classification scores but does have scores and
        alignments for individual domains.
      - Parsing FASTA reports where ungapped percent ID is < 10 and the
        regular expression to match the line was missing the possibility of
        an extra space.  This is rare, which is why we probably did not
        catch it before.
      - BLAST parsing picks up more of the statistics/parameter fields
        at the bottom of reports.  Still not fully complete.
      - SearchIO::Writer::HTMLResultWriter and TextResultWriter
        were fixed to include many improvements and added flexiblity
        in outputting the files.  Bug #1495 was also fixed in the process.
     o Bio::DB::GFF
      - Update for GFF3 compatibility.
      - Added scripts for importing from UCSC and GenBank.
      - Added a 1.2003 version number.
     o Bio::Graphics
      - Updated tutorial.
      - Added a 1.2003 version number.
     o SeqIO::swiss Bug #1504 fixed with swiss writing which was not
       properly writing keywords out.
     o Bio::SeqIO::genbank
      - Fixed bug/enhancement #1513 where dates of
        the form D-MMM-YYYY were not parsed.  Even though this is
        invalid format we can handle it - and also cleanup the date
        string so it is properly formatted.
      - Bug/enhancement #1517 fixed so that SEGMENT line can be parsed
        and written with Genbank format.  Similarly bug #1515 is fixed to
        parse in the ORIGIN text.
     o Bio::SeqIO::fasta, a new method called preferred_id_type allows you
       to specify the ID type, one of (accession accession.version
       display primary).  See Bio::SeqIO::preferred_id_type method
       documentation for more information.
     o Unigene parsing updated to handle file format changes by NCBI

1.2.2 Stable release update

    o A series of bug fixes of the Bio::OntologyIO dagflat-related parsers:
      - auto-discover ontology name
      - bug in parsing relationships when certain characters are in the term
      - fixed hard-coded prefix for term identifiers
      - various smaller issues

    o Fixed bug in Bio::Annotation::OntologyTerm of not implementing all
      of Bio::Ontology::TermI

    o brought the OBDA Registry code up to latest specs

    o Bio::DB::GenBank
      - eutils URL change
      - accession number retrieval fixed

    o Bio::SearchIO::blast - fix bug #1443 (missing last hits), parse megablast

    o Bio::SearchIO::Writer::(HTML|Text)ResultWriter fix bugs #1458,
      #1459 which now properly report alignment start/end info
      for translated BLAST/FASTA searches.

    o Bio::TreeIO::newick can parse labeled internal nodes

    o Bio::Tools::BPbl2seq can properly report strand info for HSPs
      for BLASTX if if you provide -report_type => 'BLASTX' when
      initializing a BPbl2seq object.  Bioperl 1.3 will have better
      support for bl2seq in the SearchIO system.

    o Bio::Root::IO support a -noclose boolean flag which will not
      close a filehandle upon object cleanup - useful when sharing
      a filehandle among objects.  Additionally code added s.t.
      STDOUT/STDIN/STDERR will never be closed by Root::IO cleanup.

    o Bio::Tools::Genemark bug #1435 fixed which was missing last prediction

    o Bio::SeqIO::genbank
      - bug #1456 fixed which generated extra sequence lines
      - write moltype correctly for genpept

1.2.1 Stable release update

    o Inclusion of WrapperBase, a needed component for StandAloneBlast

    o Addition from main trunk of Ontology objects, principly to allow
      BioSQL releases against 1.2.1

    o Fixes and cleanup of Bio::Coordinate modules

    o A fix to Bio::Index::EMBL allowing  retrieval of entries using
      the primary accession number

    o Other bug fixes, including bpindex GenBank fix

    o Bio::SeqIO::genbank bug #1389 fixed

1.2  Stable major release

    o More functionality added to Bio::Perl, the newbie module

    o Bug fixes in Bio::TreeIO::newick fixes bug introduced in 1.0.2
      Support for New Hampshire Extended (NHX) format parsing.

    o Bio::Tools added support for parsing Genomewise, Pseudowise, Est2Genome,
      Tmhmm, SignalP, Seg, RepeatMasker, FootPrinter, and a lightweight
      Hmmpfam parser.

    o New ontology parsing Bio::Ontology

    o Bug fixes in Bio::SearchIO for HMMer parsing, support for
      multi-report (mlib) fasta reports, support for waba and exonerate.

    o Bio::ClusterIO for parsing Unigene clusters

    o Bio::Assembly added for representing phrap and ace assembly clusters.

    o Rudimentary support for writing Chado XML (see
      GMOD project: www.gmod.org for more information)

    o Bio::Coordinate for mapping between different coordinate systems such
      as protein -> cDNA -> Exon -> DNA and back.  Useful for mapping
      features into different coordinate systems.

    o Bio::DB::GenBank/Bio::DB::GenPept now support Entrez queries
      with the get_Stream_by_query method and supports the latest
      NCBI eutils interface.

    o Bugs fixed in Bio::SeqFeature::Collection an in-memory fast
      object for extracting subsets of features : currently only
      supports extraction by location.

1.1.1 Developer release

    o Deprecated modules are now listed in the DEPRECATED file

    o New HowTo documents located in doc/howto describing
      a domain of Bioperl.

    o Note that bugs are now stored at redmine.open-bio.org/projects/bioperl/
      and all old bugs are searchable through the bugzilla interface.

    o Several reported bugs in Bio::Tools::Sigcleave and Bio::SimpleAlign
      have been addressed.

    o Support for Genewise parsing in Bio::Tools::Genewise

    o Start of Ontology framework with Bio::Ontology

    o Speedup to the Bio::Root::Root object method _rearrange.
      A global _load_module method was implemented to simplify the
      dynamic loading of modules ala Bio::SeqIO::genbank.  This
      method is now used by all the XXIO (AlignIO,TreeIO,SearchIO,SeqIO,
      etc).

    o Several performance improvements to sequence parsing in Bio::SeqIO.
      Attempt to speedup by reducing object creation overhead.

    o Bio::DB::GenBank and Bio::DB::GenPept use the NCBI's approved
      method for sequence retrieval with their E-utils CGI scripts.
      More work to support Entrez queries to their fullest is planned
      before 1.2 release.

    o Numerous fixes to Bio::SearchIO and sequence parsing (swissprot)

1.1 Developer release

    o Bio::Tools::Run has been broken off into a new pkg bioperl-run,
      this separation removes some of the complexity in our test suite
      and separates the core modules in bioperl from those that need
      external programs to run.

    o With latest ExtUtils::MakeMaker module installed SGI/IRIX should
      not run into trouble running the makefile

    o Bio::Location and Bio::SeqIO::FTHelper are fixed to properly
      read,create,and write locations for grouped/split locations
      (like mRNA features on genomic sequence).

    o Bio::Tools::Phlyo added for wrappers for parsing Molphy (protml)
      and PAML (codeml,aaml, etc) parsing.

1.0.2 Bug fix release

    o Note: The modules Bio::DB::GenBank and Bio::DB::GenPept provided
      in this release will not work after December 2002 when NCBI
      shuts off the old Entrez cgi scripts.  We have already fixed
      on our main development branch and the functionality will be
      available in the next stable bioperl release (1.2) slated for
      Fall 2002.

    o Numerous parsing bugs in Bio::SearchIO::fasta found through
      testset by Robin Emig.  These were fixed as was the get_aln
      method in Bio::Search::HSP::GenericHSP to handle the extra
      context sequence that is provided with a FastA alignment.

    o Migrating differences between Bio::Search::XX::BlastXX to
      Bio::Search::XX::GenericXX objects.  This included mechanism
      to retrieve whole list of HSPs from Hits and whole list of Hits from
      Results in addition to the current next_XX iterator methods that
      are available.  Added seq_inds() method to GenericHSP which identifies
      indexes in the query or hit sequences where conserved,identical,gaps,
      or mismatch residues are located (adapted from Steve Chervitz's
      implementation in BlastHSP).

    o Bio::DB::GFF bugs fixed and are necessary for latest GBrowse release.
      Bio::DB::GFF::RelSegment is now Bio::SeqI compliant.

    o Bio::Graphics glyph set improved and extended for GBrowse release

    o Bio::Tree::Tree get_nodes implementation improvement thanks
      to Howard Ross notice performance problem when writing out
      unbalanced trees.

    o Bio::Location::Fuzzy::new named parameter -loc_type became
      -location_type, Bio::Location::Simple::new named parameter
      -seqid becamse -seq_id.

    o Fixed major Bio::AlignIO::emboss parsing bug on needle output,
      was mis-detecting that gaps should be placed at the beginning of
      the alignment when the best alignment starts internally in the
      sequence.

1.0.1 Bug fix release

    o Minor bug fixes to Bio::DB:GFF.  Glyph sets improved.

    o Parser fixes in SearchIO blast, fasta for more complete WU BLAST
      and mixed (3.3 - 3.4) versions of FASTA.

    o Small API change to add methods for completeness across
      implementations of Bio::Search objects.  These new methods
      in the interface are implemented by the GenericXX object as well
      as the BlastXX objects.
	* Bio::Search::Result::ResultI
	 - hits() method returns list of all Hits (next_hit is an
	   iterator method)

	* Bio::Search::Hit::HitI
	 - hsps() method returns list of all HSPs (next_hsp is an
           iterator method)

    o The Bio::SearchIO::Writer classes have been fixed to handle results
       created from either psiblast (Search::BlastXX objects) or
       blast|fasta|blastxml objects (Search::GenericXX objects).  More work
       has to be done here to make it work properly and will nee major
       API changes.

    o Bugs in Bio::Tools::HMMER fixed, including
       * #1178 - Root::IO destructor wasn't being called
       * #1034 - filter_on_cutoff now behaves properly

    o Bio::SeqFeature::Computation initialization args fixed and
      tests added.

    o Tests are somewhat cleaner, flat.t now properly cleans up after itsself,

    o Updated FAQ with more example based answers to typical questions

    o Bug #1202 was fixed which would improperly join together qual values
      parsed by Bio::SeqIO::qual when a trailing space was not present before
      the newline.

1.0.0 Major Stable Release

  This represents a major release of bioperl with significant
  improvements over the 0.7.x series of releases.

    o Bio::Tools::Blast is officially deprecated.  Please see

    o Interface for executing EMBOSS programs locally in Bio::Factory::EMBOSS
      Future work will integrate Pise and allow submission of analysis on
      remote servers.

    o Bio::AnnotationCollectionI and Bio::Annotation::Collection
      introduced as new objects for handling Sequence Annotation
      information (dblinks, references, etc) and is more robust that

0.7.2 Bug fix release

    o documentation fixes in many modules - SYNOPSIS code verified
      to be runnable in many (but not all modules)

    o corrected MANIFEST file from 0.7.1 release

    o Bug fix in Bio::SeqIO::FTHelper to properly handle
      split locations

    o Bio::SeqIO::genbank
	* Correct parsing and writing of genbank format with protein data
	* moltype and molecule separation

    o Bio::SeqIO::largefasta fix to avoid inifinite loops

    o Bio::SimpleAlign fixed to correctly handle consensus
      sequence calculation

    o Bio::Tools::HMMER supports hmmer 2.2g

    o Bio::Tools::BPlite to support report type specific parsing.  Most
      major changes are not on the 0.7 branch.

    o Bio::Tools::Run::StandAloneBlast exists_blast() fixed and works
      with File::Spec

    o Bio::Variation::AAChange/RNAChange corrected labels and mutated alleles
	in several types of mutations:
        1.) AA level: deletion, complex
        2.) AA level: complex, inframe
        3.) RNA level: silent

    o  BPbl2seq parsing of empty reports will not die, but will return
       a valid, empty, Bio::SeqFeature::SimilarityFeature for
       $report->query() and $report->subject() methods.  So an easy
       way to test if report was empty is to see if
       $report->query->seqname is undefined.

0.7.1 Bug fix release

    o Better parsing of genbank/EMBL files especially fixing bugs
      related to Feature table parsing and locations on remote
      sequences.  Additionally, species name parsing was better.

    o Bio::SeqIO::genbank can parse now NCBI produced genbank database
      which include a number of header lines.

    o More strict genbank and EMBL format writing (corrected number of
      spaces where appropriate).

    o Bio::Tools::BPlite can better parse BLASTX reports - see BUGS
      for related BPlite BUGS that are unresolved in this release.

    o Bio::DB::GenBank, Bio::DB::GenPept have less problems
      downloading sequences from NCBI via HTTP.  Bio::DB::SwissProt can
      use expasy mirrors or EBI dbfetch cgi-script.

    o A moderate number of documentation improvements were made as
      well to provide a better code synopsis in each module.


0.7  Large number of changes, including refactoring of the
     Object system, new parsers, new functionality and
     all round better system. Highlights are:


     o Refactored root of inheritance: moved to a lightweight Bio::Root::RootI;
       Bio::Root::IO for I/O and file/handle capabilities.

     o Imported BPlite modules from Ian Korf for BLAST
       parsing. This is considered the supported BLAST parser;
       Bio::Tools::Blast.pm will eventually phase out due to lack of support.

     o Improved Sequence Feature model. Added complete location
       modelling (with fuzzy and compound locations).  See
       Bio::LocationI and the modules under Bio/Location.  Added
       support in Genbank/EMBL format parsing to completely parse
       feature tables for complex locations.

     o Moved special support for databanks etc to specialized modules under
       Bio/Seq/. One of these supports very large sequences through
       a temporary file as a backend.

     o Explicit Gene, Transcript and Exon SeqFeature objects, supporting
       CDS retrieval and exon shuffling.

     o More parsers: Sim4, Genscan, MZEF, ESTScan, BPbl2seq, GFF

     o Refactored Bio/DB/GenBank+GenPept. There is now also DB/SwissProt and
       DB/GDB (the latter has platform-specific limitations).

     o New analysis parser framework for HT sequence annotation (see
       Bio::SeqAnalysisParserI and Bio::Factory::SeqAnalysisParserFactory)

     o New Alignment IO framework

     o New Index modules (Swissprot)

     o New modules for running Blast within perl
       (Bio::Tools::Run::StandAloneBlast). Added modules for running
       Multiple Sequence Alignment tools ClustalW and TCoffee
       (Bio::Tools::Run::Alignment).

     o New Cookbook-style tutorial (see bptutorial.pl). Improved
       documentation across the package.

     o Much improved cross platform support. Many known incompatibilities
       have been fixed; however, NT and Mac do not work across the entire
       setup (see PLATFORMS).

     o Many bug fixes, code restructuring, etc. Overall stability and
       maintainability benefit a lot.

     o A total of 957 automatic tests


0.6.2

   There are very few functionality changes but a large
   number of software improvements/bug fixes across the package.

   o The EMBL/GenBank parsing are improved.

   o The Swissprot reading is improved. Swissprot writing
     is disabled as it doesn't work at all. This needs to
     wait for 0.7 release

   o BLAST reports with no hits are correctly parsed.

   o Several other bugs of the BLAST parser (regular expressions, ...)
     fixed.

   o Old syntax calls have been replaced with more modern syntax

   o Modules that did not work at all, in particular the Sim4
     set have been removed

   o Bio::SeqFeature::Generic and Bio::SeqFeature::FeaturePair
     have improved compliance with interface specs and documentation

   o Mailing list documentation updated throughout the distribution

   o Most minor bug fixes have happened.

   o The scripts in /examples now work and have the modern syntax
     rather than the deprecated syntax


0.6.1  Sun April 2 2000

   o Sequences can have Sequence Features attached to them
        - The sequence features can be read from or written to
          EMBL and GenBank style flat files

   o Objects for Annotation, including References (but not
     full medline abstracts), Database links and Comments are
     provided

   o A Species object to represent nodes on a taxonomy tree
     is provided

   o The ability to parse HMMER and Sim4 output has been added

   o The Blast parsing has been improved, with better PSI-BLAST
     support and better overall behaviour.

   o Flat file indexed databases provide both random access
     and sequential access to their component sequences.

   o A CodonTable object has been written with all known
     CodonTables accessible.

   o A number of new lightweight analysis tools have been
     added, such as molecular weight determination.

    The 0.6 release also has improved software engineering

   o The sequence objects have been rewritten, providing more
     maintainable and easier to implement objects. These
     objects are backwardly compatible with the 0.05.1 objects

   o Many objects are defined in terms of interfaces and then
     a Perl implementation has been provided. The interfaces
     are found in the 'I' files (module names ending in 'I').

     This means that it is possible to wrap C/CORBA/SQL access
     as true "bioperl" objects, compatible with the rest of
     bioperl.

   o The SeqIO system has been overhauled to provide better
     processing and perl-like automatic interpretation of <>
     over arguments.

   o Many more tests have been added (a total of 172 automatic
     tests are now run before release).
