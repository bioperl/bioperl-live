=head1 NAME

Bio::Search::Iteration::IterationI - Abstract interface to an
iteration from an iterated search result, such as PSI-BLAST.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Bio::Search::Iteration::IterationI objects cannot be 
    # instantiated since this module defines a pure interface.
    # Given an object that implements the 
    # Bio::Search::Iteration::IterationI interface, 
    # you can do the following things with it:

    # First, open up a SearchIO stream
    use Bio::SearchIO;
    my $file = shift or die "Usage: $0 <BLAST-report-file>\n";
    my $in = Bio::SearchIO->new(-format => 'blast',
                               -file => $file # comment out this line to read STDIN
                              );
    # Iterate over all results in the input stream
    while (my $result = $in->next_result) {

        printf "Result #%d: %s\n", $in->result_count, $result->to_string;
        printf "Total Iterations: %d\n", $result->num_iterations();

        # Iterate over all iterations and process old and new hits
        # separately.

        while( my $it = $result->next_iteration) { 
            printf "\nIteration %d\n", $it->number;
            printf "Converged: %d\n", $it->converged;

            # Print out the hits not found in previous iteration
            printf "New hits: %d\n", $it->num_hits_new;
            while( my $hit = $it->next_hit_new ) {
                printf "  %s, Expect=%g\n", $hit->name, $hit->expect; 
            }

            # Print out the hits found in previous iteration
            printf "Old hits: %d\n", $it->num_hits_old; 
            while( my $hit = $it->next_hit_old ) {
                printf "  %s, Expect=%g\n", $hit->name, $hit->expect; 
            }
        }
        printf "%s\n\n", '-' x 50;
    }

    printf "Total Reports processed: %d: %s\n", $in->result_count;

    __END__

    # NOTE: The following functionality is just proposed
    # (does not yet exist but might, given sufficient hew and cry):

    # Zero-in on the new hits found in last iteration.
    # By default, iteration() returns the last one.

    my $last_iteration = $result->iteration();
    while( my $hit = $last_iteration->next_hit) {
        # Do something with new hit...
    }

    # Get the first iteration

    my $first_iteration = $result->iteration(1);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Bio::Search::Result::ResultI objects are data structures containing
the results from the execution of a search algorithm.  As such, it may
contain various algorithm specific information as well as details of
the execution, but will contain a few fundamental elements, including
the ability to return Bio::Search::Hit::HitI objects.

=head2 Classification of Hits

Within a given iteration, the hits can be classified into a number of
useful subsets based on whether or not the hit appeard in a previous
iteration and whether or not the hit is below the threshold E-value
for inclusion in the score matrix model.

                           All hits
                             (A)
               _______________|_________________

      _________|________                _______|_________

                         below threshold       above threshold
                              (H)                  (I)

Notes: The term I<threshold> in the diagram and descriptions below
refer to this inclusion threshold. I<Below threshold> actually means
I<at or below threshold>.

The IterationI interface defines a number of methods for extracting
these subsets of hits.

=over 4

=item * newhits_below_threshold() [subset D]

Hits that did not appear in a previous iteration and are below
threshold in the current iteration.

=item * newhits_not_below_threshold() [subset E]

Hits that did not appear in a previous iteration and are not below
threshold in the current iteration.

=item * newhits() [subset B]

All newly found hits, below and above the inclusion threshold.  This
is the union of newhits_below_threshold() + newhits_not_below_threshold()
[subset D + subset E].

=item * oldhits_below_threshold() [subset H]

Hits that appeared in a previous iteration below threshold and are
still below threshold in the current iteration.

=item * oldhits_newly_below_threshold() [subset I]

Hits that appeared in a previous iteration above threshold but are
below threshold in the current iteration. (Not applicable to the first
iteration.)

=item * oldhits_not_below_threshold() [subset G]

Hits that appeared in a previous iteration not below threshold and
are still not below threshold in the current iteration.

=item * oldhits()  [subset C]

All hits that occured in a previous iteration, whether below or above
threshold in the current iteration. Union of oldhits_below_threshold()
+ oldhits_newly_below_threshold() + oldhits_not_below_threshold()
[subset H + subset I + subset G]. (Not applicable to the first
iteration.)

=item * hits_below_threshold() [subset D + subset F]

All hits, old and new, that are below the inclusion threshold in this
iteration. This is the union of newhits_below_threshold() +
oldhits_below_threshold() + oldhits_newly_below_threshold()
[subset D + subset H + subset I].

=item * hits() [subset A]

The union of newhits() and oldhits() [subset B + subset C].

=back

For the first iteration, the methods L<oldhits>, L<oldhits_below_threshold>,
L<oldhits_newly_below_threshold>, and oldhits_not_below_threshold()
will return empty lists.

Iterator and numbers-of-hit methods are provided for subsets A, B, and C:

=over 4

=item * next_hit_new(), num_hits_new() [subset B]

=item * next_hit_old(), num_hits_old() [subset C]

=item * next_hit(), num_hits() [subset A]

reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.

to determine whether it is new or old.

To get just the old hits, use L<next_hit_old>.
