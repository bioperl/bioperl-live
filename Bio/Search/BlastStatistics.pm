=head1 NAME

Bio::Search::BlastStatistics - An object for Blast statistics

=head1 SYNOPSIS

          # this is a wrapper to hold the statistics from a Blast report
     my $bs = $result->get_statistics();
          # you can get a statistic generically, like this:
     my $kappa  = $bs->get_statistic("kappa");
          # or specifically, like this:
     my $kappa2 = $bs->get_kappa();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a basic container to hold the statistics returned from a Blast.
