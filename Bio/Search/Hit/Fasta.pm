=head1 NAME

Bio::Search::Hit::Fasta - Hit object specific for Fasta-generated hits

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # You wouldn't normally create these manually; 
  # instead they would be produced by Bio::SearchIO::fasta

  use Bio::Search::Hit::Fasta;
  my $hit = Bio::Search::Hit::Fasta->new(id=>'LBL_6321', desc=>'lipoprotein', e_val=>0.01);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Bio::Search::Hit::HitI> objects are data structures that contain information
about specific hits obtained during a library search.  Some information will
be algorithm-specific, but others will be generally defined, such as the
ability to obtain alignment objects corresponding to each hit.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Bio::Search::Hit::HitI>,
L<Bio::Search::Hit::GenericHit>,
L<Bio::SearchIO::fasta>.

# Let the code begin...

package Bio::Search::Hit::Fasta;

use vars qw($AUTOLOAD);
use strict;

use base qw(Bio::Search::Hit::HitI);

my @AUTOLOAD_OK = qw(_ID _DESC _SIZE _INITN _INIT1 _OPT _ZSC _E_VAL);

=head2 _initialize

 Function: where the heavy stuff will happen when new is called

=cut

sub _initialize {
    my($self, %args) = @_;

    my $make = $self->SUPER::_initialize(%args);

    while (my ($key, $val) = each %args) {

	$self->$key($val);
    }

    return $make; # success - we hope!
}

=head2 AUTOLOAD

 Function: Provide getter/setters for ID,DESC,SIZE,INITN,INIT1,OPT,ZSC,E_VAL

=cut

sub AUTOLOAD {
    my ($self, $val) = @_;

    $AUTOLOAD =~ s/.*:://;

        return $self->{$AUTOLOAD};
    } else {
        $self->throw("Unallowed accessor: $AUTOLOAD !");
