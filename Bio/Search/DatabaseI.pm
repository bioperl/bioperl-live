=head1 NAME

Bio::Search::DatabaseI - Interface for a database used in a sequence search

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Bio::Search::DatabaseI objects should not be instantiated since this
module defines a pure interface.

Given an object that implements the Bio::Search::DatabaseI  interface,
you can do the following things with it:

    $name = $db->name();

    $date = $db->date();

    $num_letters = $db->letters();

    $num_entries = $db->entries();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module defines methods for an object that provides metadata
information about a database used for sequence searching.
