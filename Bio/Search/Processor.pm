 Title   : new
 Usage   : $proc = Bio::Search::Processor->new -file      => $filename,
                                              -algorithm => 'Algorithm' ;
 Function: Used to specify and initialize a data processor of search
           algorithm results.
 Returns : A processor specific to the algorithm type, if it exists.
 Args    : -file => filename
           -algorithm => algorithm specifier
           -fh => filehandle to attach to (file or fh required)
