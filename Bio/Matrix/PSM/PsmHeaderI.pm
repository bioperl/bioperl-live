=head1 NAME

Bio::Matrix::PSM::PsmHeaderI - handles the header data from a PSM file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Bio::Matrix::PSM::IO;
 #Obtain an Bio::Matrix::PSM::IO object:
 my $psmIO= Bio::Matrix::PSM::IO->new(-file=>$file, -format=>'mast');

 #Get some general data about the file you are parsing:
 my $release=$psmIO->release;
 my $version=$psmIO->version;

 print "This analysis was performed using MAST version $version, release $release\n";

 #Now let's see what are the consensus sequences of the motifs fed as an input:
 my %seq=$psmIO->seq;

 #let's cycle through all consensus sequences now:

 foreach my $id ($psmIO->hid) {
   print "Motif $id is \t",$seq{$id},"\n";
 }

  #Finally look at the stuff we do not parse:
  my @inputfile=grep(/datafile/i,$psmIO->unstructured);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generally you should not use this object directly, you can access the
information through a PSM driver (See Bio::Matrix::PSM::IO). It is
handling the header data from a PSM file which may be very
different. This means that some of the methods will return undef
naturally, because this information is not present in the file which
is parsed. Some important data might be left over in the unstructured
part, and you might have to parse it yourself. I will try to
'structure' this header more in the near future.


=head1 FEEDBACK

=head2 Mailing Lists

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this
and other Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably
 to one of the Bioperl mailing lists.
Your participation is much appreciated.

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.

=head2 Reporting Bugs

Report bugs to the Bioperl bug tracking system to help us keep track
the bugs and their resolution.  Bug reports can be submitted via the

=head2 length

 Title   : length
 Usage   : my %length= $header->length();
 Function: Returns the length of the input sequence or motifs as a hash, indexed
           by a sequence ID (motif id or accession number)
 Throws  :
 Example :
 Returns :  hash
 Args    :


=cut

sub length {
     my $self = shift;
    $self->throw_not_implemented();
}

=head2 instances

 Title   : instances
 Usage   : my %instances= $header->length();
 Function: Returns the instance, used  as a hash, indexed
           by a sequence ID (motif id or accession number)
 Throws  :
 Example :
 Returns :  hash of Bio::Matrix::PSM::InstanceSite objects
 Args    :

}


=head2 unstuctured

 Title   : unstuctured
 Usage   : my @unstructured= $header->unstuctured();
 Function: Returns the unstructured data in the header as an array, one line per
