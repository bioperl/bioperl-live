=head1 NAME

Bio::Matrix::PSM::SiteMatrixI - SiteMatrixI implementation, holds a
position scoring matrix (or position weight matrix) and log-odds

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # You cannot use this module directly; see Bio::Matrix::PSM::SiteMatrix
  # for an example implementation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SiteMatrix is designed to provide some basic methods when working with position
scoring (weight) matrices, such as transcription factor binding sites for
example. A DNA PSM consists of four vectors with frequencies {A,C,G,T}. This is
the minimum information you should provide to construct a PSM object. The
vectors can be provided as strings with frequenciesx10 rounded to an int, going
from {0..a} and 'a' represents the maximum (10). This is like MEME's compressed
representation of a matrix and it is quite useful when working with relational
DB. If arrays are provided as an input (references to arrays actually) they can
be any number, real or integer (frequency or count).

When creating the object you can ask the constructor to make a simple pseudo
count correction by adding a number (typically 1) to all positions (with the
-correction option). After adding the number the frequencies will be
calculated. Only use correction when you supply counts, not frequencies.

Throws an exception if: You mix as an input array and string (for example A
matrix is given as array, C - as string). The position vector is (0,0,0,0). One
of the probability vectors is shorter than the rest.

Summary of the methods I use most frequently (details bellow):

  iupac - return IUPAC compliant consensus as a string
  score - Returns the score as a real number
  IC - information content. Returns a real number
  id - identifier. Returns a string
  accession - accession number. Returns a string
  next_pos - return the sequence probably for each letter, IUPAC
      symbol, IUPAC probability and simple sequence
  consenus letter for this position. Rewind at the end. Returns a hash.
  pos - current position get/set. Returns an integer.
  regexp - construct a regular expression based on IUPAC consensus.
      For example AGWV will be [Aa][Gg][AaTt][AaCcGg]
  width - site width
  get_string - gets the probability vector for a single base as a string.
  get_array - gets the probability vector for a single base as an array.
  get_logs_array - gets the log-odds vector for a single base as an array.

New methods, which might be of interest to anyone who wants to store PSM in a relational
database without creating an entry for each position is the ability to compress the
PSM vector into a string with losing usually less than 1% of the data.
this can be done with:

  my $str=$matrix->get_compressed_freq('A');

or

  my $str=$matrix->get_compressed_logs('A');

Loading from a database should be done with new, but is not yest implemented.
However you can still uncompress such string with:

  my @arr=Bio::Matrix::PSM::_uncompress_string ($str,1,1); for PSM

or

  my @arr=Bio::Matrix::PSM::_uncompress_string ($str,1000,2); for log odds
