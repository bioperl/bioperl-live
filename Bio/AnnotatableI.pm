=head1 NAME

Bio::AnnotatableI - the base interface an annotatable object must implement

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::SeqIO;
    # get an annotatable object somehow: for example, Bio::SeqI objects
    # are annotatable
    my $seqio = Bio::SeqIO->new(-fh => \*STDIN, -format => 'genbank');
    while (my $seq = $seqio->next_seq()) {
        # $seq is-a Bio::AnnotatableI, hence:
        my $ann_coll = $seq->annotation();
        # $ann_coll is-a Bio::AnnotationCollectionI, hence:
        my @all_anns = $ann_coll->get_Annotations();
        # do something with the annotation objects
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the base interface that all annotatable objects must implement. A 
good example is Bio::Seq which is an AnnotableI object.
