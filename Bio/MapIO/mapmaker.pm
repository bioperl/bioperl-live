=head1 NAME

Bio::MapIO::mapmaker - A Mapmaker Map reader

=head1 SYNOPSIS

# do not use this object directly it is accessed through the Bio::MapIO system 

    use Bio::MapIO;
    my $mapio = Bio::MapIO->new(-format => "mapmaker",
			                      -file   => "mapfile.map");
    while ( my $map = $mapio->next_map ) {  # get each map
	    foreach my $marker ( $map->each_element ) {
	       # loop through the markers associated with the map
	    }
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object contains code for parsing and processing Mapmaker output
and creating L<Bio::Map::MapI> objects from it.

	# from a terminal, with no particular format before or after the
