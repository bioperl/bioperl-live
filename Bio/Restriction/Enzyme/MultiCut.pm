## POD Documentation:

=head1 NAME

Bio::Restriction::Enzyme::MultiCut - A single restriction endonuclease

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # set up a single restriction enzyme. This contains lots of
  # information about the enzyme that is generally parsed from a
  # rebase file and can then be read back

  use Bio::Restriction::Enzyme;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module defines a restriction endonuclease class where one object
represents one of the distinct recognition sites for that enzyme. The
method L<others|others> stores references to other objects with
alternative sites.

In this schema each object within an EnzymeCollection can be checked
for matching a sequence.

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to one
of the Bioperl mailing lists. Your participation is much appreciated.

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.
