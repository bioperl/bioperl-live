=head1 NAME

Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection - Set of restriction endonucleases

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection;

  # Create a collection with the default enzymes.
  my $default_collection = Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection->new();

  # Or create a collection from a REBASE 'withrefm' file obtained from
  # ftp://ftp.neb.com/pub/rebase/. (See Bio::Restriction::IO for more
  # information.)
  my $rebase = Bio::Restriction::IO->new(
      -file   => 'withrefm.610',
      -format => 'withrefm' );
  my $rebase_collection = $rebase->read();

  # Or create an empty collection and set the enzymes later. See
  # 'CUSTOM COLLECTIONS' below for more information.
  my $empty_collection =
    Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection->new( -empty => 1 );

  # Get an array of Bio::Restriction::Enzyme objects from the collection.
  my @enzymes = $default_collection->each_enzyme();

  # Get a Bio::Restriction::Enzyme object for a particular enzyme by name.
  my $enz = $default_collection->get_enzyme( 'EcoRI' );

  # Get a Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection object containing the enzymes
  # that have the equivalent of 6-bp recognition sequences.
  my $six_cutters = $default_collection->cutters( 6 );

  # Get a Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection object containing the enzymes
  # that are rare cutters.
  my $rare_cutters = $default_collection->cutters( -start => 6, -end => 8 );

  # Get a Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection object that contains enzymes
  # that generate blunt ends:
  my $blunt_cutters = $default_collection->blunt_enzymes();

  # See 'CUSTOM COLLECTIONS' below for an example of creating a
  # Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection object with a specified subset of
  # enzymes using methods provided by the Bio::RestrictionEnzyme class.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection represents a collection of
restriction enzymes.

If you create a new collection directly rather than from a REBASE
file using L<Bio::Restriction::IO>, it will be populated by a
default set of enzymes with site and cut information
only.

Use L<Bio::Restriction::Analysis> to figure out which enzymes are
available and where they cut your sequence.

=head1 CUSTOM COLLECTIONS

Note that the underlying L<Bio::Restriction::Enzyme> objects have a rich
variety of methods that allow more complicated selections than the methods
that are defined by Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection.

For example, the way to create a custom collection of Type II enzymes
is as follows:

  my $complete_collection =
      Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection->new();
  my $type_ii_collection  =
      Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection->new( -empty => 1 );
  $type_ii_collection->enzymes(
      grep { $_->type() eq 'II' } $complete_collection->each_enzyme() );

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Bio::Restriction::IO> - read in enzymes from REBASE files

L<Bio::Restriction::Analysis> - figure out what enzymes cut a sequence

L<Bio::Restriction::Enzyme> - define a single restriction enzyme

=head1 FEEDBACK

=head2 Mailing Lists 

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to one
of the Bioperl mailing lists. Your participation is much appreciated.

  bioperl-l@bioperl.org                  - General discussion
  http://bioperl.org/wiki/Mailing_lists  - About the mailing lists

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.

=head2 Reporting Bugs

Report bugs to the Bioperl bug tracking system to help us keep track
the bugs and their resolution. Bug reports can be submitted via the

 Title     : new
 Function  : Initializes the Restriction::EnzymeCollection object
 Returns   : The Restriction::EnzymeCollection object
 Arguments : optional named parameter -empty

Set parameter -empty to true if you do NOT want the collection be
populated by the default set of prototype type II enzymes.

Alternatively, pass an array of enzymes to -enzymes parameter.
