=head1 NAME

Bio::Restriction::IO::itype2 - itype2 enzyme set

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Do not use this module directly.  Use it via the Bio::Restriction::IO class.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is tab delimited, entry per line format which is fast to process.

=head1 FEEDBACK

=head2 Mailing Lists

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to the
Bioperl mailing lists Your participation is much appreciated.

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.

=head2 Reporting Bugs

Report bugs to the Bioperl bug tracking system to help us keep track
the bugs and their resolution.  Bug reports can be submitted via the

 Title   : read
 Usage   : $renzs = $stream->read
