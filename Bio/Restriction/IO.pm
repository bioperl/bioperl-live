=head1 NAME

Bio::Restriction::IO - Handler for sequence variation IO Formats

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::Restriction::IO;

    $in  = Bio::Restriction::IO->new(-file => "inputfilename" ,
                                     -format => 'withrefm');
    my $res = $in->read; # a Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Bio::Restriction::IO> is a handler module for the formats in the
Restriction IO set, e.g. C<Bio::Restriction::IO::xxx>. It is the
officially sanctioned way of getting at the format objects, which most
people should use.

The structure, conventions and most of the code is inherited from
L<Bio::SeqIO>. The main difference is that instead of using methods
C<next_seq>, you drop C<_seq> from the method name.

Also, instead of dealing only with individual L<Bio::Restriction::Enzyme>
objects, C<read()> will slurp in all enzymes into a 
L<Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection> object.

For more details, see documentation in L<Bio::SeqIO>.

=head1 TO DO

At the moment, these can be use mainly to get a custom set if enzymes in
C<withrefm> or C<itype2> formats into L<Bio::Restriction::Enzyme> or
L<Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection> objects.  Using C<bairoch> format is
highly experimental and is not recommmended at this time.

This class inherits from L<Bio::SeqIO> for convenience sake, though this should
inherit from L<Bio::Root::Root>.  Get rid of L<Bio::SeqIO> inheritance by
copying relevant methods in.

C<write()> methods are currently not implemented for any format except C<base>.
Using C<write()> even with C<base> format is not recommended as it does not
support multicut/multisite enzyme output.

Should additional formats be supported (such as XML)?

=head1 FEEDBACK

=head2 Mailing Lists

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to the
Bioperl mailing lists Your participation is much appreciated.

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.

=head2 Reporting Bugs

report bugs to the Bioperl bug tracking system to help us keep track
the bugs and their resolution.  Bug reports can be submitted via the
