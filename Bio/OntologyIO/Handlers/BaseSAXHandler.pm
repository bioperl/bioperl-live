=head1 NAME

Bio::OntologyIO::Handlers::BaseSAXHandler base class for SAX Handlers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See description.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is an abstract module, serving as the base of any SAX Handler 
implementation. It tries to offer the framework that SAX handlers generally 
need, such as tag_stack, char_store, etc.

In the implementation handler, you can take advantage of this based module by
the following suggestions.

1) In start_element,

 sub start_element {
     my $self=shift;
     my $tag=$_[0]->{Name};
     my %args=%{$_[0]->{Attributes}};
     # Your code here.

     # Before you conclude the method, write these 2 line.
     $self->_visited_count_inc($tag);
     $self->_push_tag($tag);
 }

2) In end_element,

 sub end_element {
     my $self=shift;
     my $tag=shift->{Name};
     # Your code here.

     # Before you conclude the method, write these 2 lines.
     $self->_visited_count_dec($tag);
     $self->_pop_tag;
 }

3) In characters, or any other methods where you may use the tag
stack or count

 sub characters {
     my $self=shift;
     my $text=shift->{Data};

     $self->_chars_hash->{$self->_top_tag} .= $text;

 }
 $count = $self->_visited_count('myTag');
 $tag = $self->_top_tag;
