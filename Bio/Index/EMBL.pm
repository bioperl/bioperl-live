=head1 NAME

Bio::Index::EMBL - Interface for indexing (multiple) EMBL/Swissprot
.dat files (i.e. flat file EMBL/Swissprot format).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Complete code for making an index for several
    # EMBL files
    use Bio::Index::EMBL;
    use strict;

    my $Index_File_Name = shift;
    my $inx = Bio::Index::EMBL->new(-filename => $Index_File_Name,
				    -write_flag => 'WRITE');
    $inx->make_index(@ARGV);

    # Print out several sequences present in the index
    # in Fasta format
    use Bio::Index::EMBL;
    use strict;

    my $Index_File_Name = shift;
    my $inx = Bio::Index::EMBL->new(-filename => $Index_File_Name);
    my $out = Bio::SeqIO->new(-format => 'Fasta',-fh => \*STDOUT);

    foreach my $id (@ARGV) {
        my $seq = $inx->fetch($id); # Returns Bio::Seq object
	$out->write_seq($seq);
    }

    # alternatively
    my ($id, $acc);
    my $seq1 = $inx->get_Seq_by_id($id);
    my $seq2 = $inx->get_Seq_by_acc($acc);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Inherits functions for managing dbm files from Bio::Index::Abstract.pm,
and provides the basic funtionallity for indexing EMBL files, and
retrieving the sequence from them. Heavily snaffled from James Gilbert
and his Fasta system. Note: for best results 'use strict'.

The keys are the identifiers in the ID and AC lines.

=head2 Mailing Lists

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to one
of the Bioperl mailing lists.  Your participation is much appreciated.

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.

=head2 Reporting Bugs

Report bugs to the Bioperl bug tracking system to help us keep track
the bugs and their resolution.  Bug reports can be submitted via the

=head2 _index_file

  Title   : _index_file
  Usage   : $index->_index_file( $file_name, $i )
  Function: Specialist function to index EMBL format files.
            Is provided with a filename and an integer
            by make_index in its SUPER class.
  Example : 
  Returns : 
  Args    :

                # of the last found record.
        $id,    # ID of last found record.
	@accs,   # accession of last record. Also put into the index
        );
