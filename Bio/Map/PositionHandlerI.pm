=head1 NAME

Bio::Map::PositionHandlerI - A Position Handler Interface

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # do not use this module directly
    # See Bio::Map::PositionHandler for an example of
    # implementation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This interface describes the basic methods required for Position Handlers. A
Position Handler copes with the coordination of different Bio::Map::EntityI
objects, adding and removing them from each other and knowning who belongs to
who. These relationships between objects are based around shared Positions,
hence PositionHandler.

=head1 FEEDBACK

=head2 Mailing Lists

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to
the Bioperl mailing list.  Your participation is much appreciated.

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.
