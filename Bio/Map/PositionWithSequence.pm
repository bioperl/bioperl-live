=head1 NAME

Bio::Map::PositionWithSequence - A position with a sequence.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::Map::PositionWithSequence;
    
    my $pos = Bio::Map::PositionWithSequence->new(-map => $map, 
                                -element => $element,
                                -start => 0,
                                -seq => 'ATGC');


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Have a position with a sequence, eg. define what the binding site sequence of
a certain transcription factor binding site is by modelling it as one of these
objects with the -element assigned to a Bio::Map::TranscriptionFactor instance.

=head2 Mailing Lists

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to
the Bioperl mailing list.  Your participation is much appreciated.

 Title   : new
 Usage   : my $obj = Bio::Map::PositionWithSequence->new();
 Function: Builds a new Bio::Map::PositionWithSequence object 
 Returns : Bio::Map::PositionWithSequence
 Args    : -map      => Bio::Map::GeneMap object
           -element  => Bio::Map::Gene object
           -relative => Bio::Map::GeneRelative object
           -seq      => string, length of this string will set the length
                        of this position's range

           * If this position has no range, or if a single value can describe
             the range *

                                          point position or range of this
                                          Position, most likely an int

=head2 seq

 Title   : seq
 Usage   : my $string = $obj->seq();
 Function: Get/set the sequence as a string of letters.
 Returns : scalar
 Args    : Optionally on set the new value (a string). An optional second
           argument presets the alphabet (otherwise it will be guessed).
