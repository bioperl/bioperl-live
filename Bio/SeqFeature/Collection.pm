=head1 NAME

Bio::SeqFeature::Collection - A container class for SeqFeatures
suitable for performing operations such as finding features within a
range, that match a certain feature type, etc.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::SeqFeature::Collection;
  use Bio::Location::Simple;
  use Bio::Tools::GFF;
  use Bio::Root::IO;
  use File::Spec;
  # let's first input some features
  my $gffio = Bio::Tools::GFF->new(-file => File::Spec->catfile
  				 ("t","data","myco_sites.gff"),
  				 -gff_version => 2);
  my @features = ();
  # loop over the input stream
  while(my $feature = $gffio->next_feature()) {
      # do something with feature
      push @features, $feature;
  }
  $gffio->close();
  # build the Collection object
  my $col = Bio::SeqFeature::Collection->new();
  # add these features to the object
  my $totaladded = $col->add_features(\@features);

  my @subset = $col->features_in_range(-start => 1,
  				     -end => 25000,
  				     -strand => 1,
  				     -contain => 0);
  # subset should have 18 entries for this dataset
  print "size is ", scalar @subset, "\n";
  @subset = $col->features_in_range(-range => Bio::Location::Simple->new
  				  (-start => 70000,
  				   -end => 150000,
  				   -strand => -1),
  				  -contain => 1,
  				  -strandmatch => 'strong');

  # subset should have 22 entries for this dataset
  print "size is ", scalar @subset, "\n";
  print "total number of features in collection is ",
         $col->feature_count(),"\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object will efficiently allow one for query subsets of ranges
within a large collection of sequence features (in fact the objects
just have to be Bio::RangeI compliant).  This is done by the creation
of bins which are stored in order in a B-Tree data structure as
provided by the DB_File interface to the Berkeley DB.

This is based on work done by Lincoln for storage in a mysql instance
- this is intended to be an embedded in-memory implementation for
easily querying for subsets of a large range set.

Collections can be made persistent by keeping the indexfile and
passing in the -keep flag like this:

  my $collection = Bio::SeqFeature::Collection->new(-keep => 1,
                                                   -file => 'col.idx');
  $collaction->add_features(\@features);
  undef $collection;

  # To reuse this collection, next time you initialize a Collection object
  # specify the filename and the index will be reused.
  $collection = Bio::SeqFeature::Collection->new(-keep => 1,
                                                -file => 'col.idx');



=head1 FEEDBACK

=head2 Mailing Lists

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to
the Bioperl mailing list.  Your participation is much appreciated.

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.

=head2 Reporting Bugs

Report bugs to the Bioperl bug tracking system to help us keep track
of the bugs and their resolution. Bug reports can be submitted via

Using code and strategy developed by Lincoln Stein (lstein@cshl.org)
in Bio::DB::GFF implementation.  Credit also to Lincoln for suggesting
using Storable to serialize features rather than my previous implementation
which kept the features in memory.

 Args    :

           -minbin        minimum value to use for binning

           -maxbin        maximum value to use for binning
                          (default is 1,000)
           -file          filename to store/read the
                          BTREE from rather than an in-memory structure
                          (default is false and in-memory).
           -keep          boolean, will not remove index file on
