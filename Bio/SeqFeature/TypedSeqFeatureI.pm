=head1 NAME

Bio::SeqFeature::TypedSeqFeatureI - a strongly typed SeqFeature

=head1 SYNOPSIS


   # get Sequence Features in some manner, eg
   # from a Sequence object

    foreach $sf ( $seq->get_SeqFeatures() ) {
        # all sequence features must have primary_tag() return a string
        $type_as_string = $sf->primary_tag();
	if( $sf->isa("Bio::SeqFeature::TypedSeqFeatureI") ) {
            $ot = $sf->ontology_term();
            print "Ontology identifier:",$ot->identifier(),
                  " name:",$ot->name(),
                  " Description:",$ot->description(),"\n";

        } else {
            print "Sequence Feature does not have an ontology type\n";
	}

    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This interface describes the extension of SeqFeatureI 
to being a strongly typed SeqFeature.

Bio::SeqFeature::TypedSeqFeatureI extends the Bio::SeqFeatureI
interface (ie, a TypedSeqFeatureI feature must also implement
all the Bio::SeqFeatureI interface as well). 

It is suggested that the primary_tag() method of SeqFeatureI
return the same as the ontology_term()-E<gt>name() of the OntologyTypedI
(ie, the "string" name of the ontology type is used as the primary
tag), but this should not be assummed by client code as they
are scenarios where one would like to maintain the difference.

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.
