=head1 NAME

Bio::Tree::TreeFunctionsI - Decorated Interface implementing basic Tree exploration methods

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::TreeIO;
  my $in = Bio::TreeIO->new(-format => 'newick', -file => 'tree.tre');

  my $tree = $in->next_tree;

  my @nodes = $tree->find_node('id1');

  if( $tree->is_monophyletic(-nodes => \@nodes, -outgroup => $outnode) ){
   #...
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This interface provides a set of implementated Tree functions which
only use the defined methods in the TreeI or NodeI interface.

=head1 FEEDBACK

=head2 Mailing Lists

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to
the Bioperl mailing list.  Your participation is much appreciated.

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.

=head2 Reporting Bugs

Report bugs to the Bioperl bug tracking system to help us keep track
of the bugs and their resolution. Bug reports can be submitted via the
web:

=head2 find_node

 Title   : find_node
 Usage   : my @nodes = $self->find_node(-id => 'node1');
 Function: returns all nodes that match a specific field, by default this
           is id, but different branch_length, 
 Returns : List of nodes which matched search
 Args    : text string to search for
           OR
           -fieldname => $textstring

   # all this work for a '-' named field
   # is so that we could potentially 
   # expand to other constraints in 
   # different implementations
   # like 'find all nodes with boostrap < XX'

   # could actually do this by testing $rootnode->can($type) but

   # - although it is unlikely that the root node would be richer than the
   # leaf nodes.  Can't handle NHX tags right now

=head2 remove_Node

 Title   : remove_Node
 Usage   : $tree->remove_Node($node)
 Function: Removes a node from the tree
 Returns : boolean represent status of success
 Args    : either Bio::Tree::NodeI or string of the node id

=cut

}

=head2 get_lineage_nodes

 Title   : get_lineage_nodes
 Usage   : my @nodes = $tree->get_lineage_nodes($node);
 Function: Get the full lineage of a node (all its ancestors, in the order
           root->most recent ancestor)
 Returns : list of nodes
 Args    : either Bio::Tree::NodeI or string of the node id

    # when dealing with Bio::Taxon objects with databases, the root will always
    # be the database's root, ignoring this Tree's set root node; prefer the
    # Tree's idea of root.
    my $root = $self->get_root_node || '';

        unshift(@lineage, $node);
        $node eq $root && last;
    }
    return @lineage;
}

=head2 splice

 Title   : splice
 Usage   : $tree->splice(-remove_id => \@ids);
 Function: Remove all the nodes from a tree that correspond to the supplied
           args, making all the descendents of a removed node the descendents
           of the removed node's ancestor.
           You can ask to explicitly remove certain nodes by using -remove_*,
           remove them conditionally by using -remove_* in combination with
           -keep_*, or remove everything except certain nodes by using only
           -keep_*.
 Returns : n/a
 Args    : just a list of Bio::Tree::NodeI objects to remove, OR
           -key => value pairs, where -key has the prefix 'remove' or 'keep',
           followed by an underscore, followed by a fieldname (like for the
           method find_node). Value should be a scalar or an array ref of
           scalars (again, like you might supply to find_node).

           So (-remove_id => [1, 2]) will remove all nodes from the tree that
           have an id() of '1' or '2', while
           (-remove_id => [1, 2], -keep_id => [2]) will remove all nodes with
           an id() of '1'.
           (-keep_id => [2]) will remove all nodes unless they have an id() of
           '2' (note, no -remove_*).

           -preserve_lengths => 1 : setting this argument will splice out
           intermediate nodes, preserving the original total length between
           the ancestor and the descendants of the spliced node. Undef 
           by default.

=head2 get_lca

 Usage   : merge_lineage($node)
 Function: Merge a lineage of nodes with this tree.
 Returns : n/a
 Args    : Bio::Tree::TreeI with only one leaf, OR
           Bio::Tree::NodeI which has an ancestor

 For example, if we are the tree $tree:

 +---B

 A
 |
 +---C

 and we want to merge the lineage $other_tree:

 A---C---D

 After calling $tree->merge_lineage($other_tree), $tree looks like:

 Title   : contract_linear_paths
 Usage   : contract_linear_paths()
 Function: Splices out all nodes in the tree that have an ancestor and only one
           descendent.
 Returns : n/a
 Args    : none for normal behaviour, true to dis-regard the ancestor requirment
           and re-root the tree as necessary

 For example, if we are the tree $tree:

             +---E
             |
 A---B---C---D
             |

 After calling $tree->contract_linear_paths(), $tree looks like:

     +---E
     |
 A---D

 Instead, $tree->contract_linear_paths(1) would have given:

=head2 force_binary

 Title   : force_binary
 Usage   : force_binary()
 Function: Forces the tree into a binary tree, splitting branches arbitrarily
           and creating extra nodes as necessary, such that all nodes have
           exactly two or zero descendants.
 Returns : n/a
 Args    : none

 For example, if we are the tree $tree:

 +---G
 |
 +---F
 |
 +---E
 |
 A
 |
 +---D
 |
 +---C
 |
 +---B

 (A has 6 descendants B-G)

 After calling $tree->force_binary(), $tree looks like:

         +---X
         |
     +---X
     |   |
     |   +---X
     |
 +---X
 |   |
 |   |   +---G
 |   |   |
 |   +---X

 |       +---F
 A

     |
     |   +---C
     |   |
     +---X
         |

 (Where X are artificially created nodes with ids 'artificial_n', where n is
 an integer making the id unique within the tree)

 Usage   : my $leaves_string = $tree->simplify_to_leaves_string()
 Function: Creates a simple textual representation of the relationship between

 Returns : string

line giving names to traits. The first column contains the leaf node
ids. Subsequent columns contain different trait value sets. Columns
numbering starts from 0. The default trait column is the second
(1). The returned hashref has one special key, my_trait_name, that
holds the trait name. Single or double quotes are removed.
