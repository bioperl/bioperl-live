=head1 NAME

Bio::Phenotype::MeSH::Twig - Context for a MeSH term

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::Phenotype::MeSH::Twig
  # create a twig object
  my $twig = Bio::Phenotype::MeSH::Twig->new();

  # the term has only one parent in any twig
  $twig->parent('Fats');


  # a twig makeas sense only in the context of a term
  # which is a  Bio::Phenotype::MeSH::Term object

  # a term can have many twigs i.e. it can appear in many places in
  # the hierarchy
  #
  $ term->add_twig($twig);

  # adding the twig into a term adds a link into into it 
  $twig->term eq $term;

  # a twig can know about other terms under the parant node
  $twig->add_sister('Bread', 'Candy', 'Cereals');
  print join ( ', ', $twig->each_sister()), "\n";

  # a twig can know about other terms under this term
  $twig->add_child('Butter', 'Margarine');
  print join ( ', ', $twig->each_child()), "\n";



=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the immediate surrounding of a MeSH term. It
keeps track on nodes names above the current node ('parent') other
nodes at the same level ('sisters') and nodes under it ('children').
Note that these are name strings, not objects.

Each twig can be associated with only one term, but term can have
multiple twigs. (Twigs can be though to be roles for a term.)

=head2 Mailing Lists

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to the 
Bioperl mailing lists  Your participation is much appreciated.

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.
