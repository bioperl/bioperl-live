=head1 NAME

Bio::Phenotype::MeSH::Term - A MeSH term

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::Phenotype::MeSH::Term;

  # create a term object
  my $term = Bio::Phenotype::MeSH::Term->new
      (-id => 'D000001',
       -name => 'Dietary Fats',
       -description => 'dietary fats are...'
      );

  # get a Bio::Phenotype::MeSH::Twig somehow...
  $term->add_twig($twig1);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class keeps information about MeSH terms. MeSH stands for Medical
Subject Headings and is one of the ways for annotaing biomedical
literature.  The terminology is maintained by National Library of
Medicine of USA . See http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html.

In addition to id, name and description a term can know about its
surrounding terms (Bio::Phenotype::MeSH::Twig) in the term hierarchy.

This class is mainly used from Bio::DB::MeSH which retrieves terms
over the Web.

=head1 FEEDBACK

=head2 Mailing Lists

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to the 
Bioperl mailing lists  Your participation is much appreciated.

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.

=head2 Twig management

Each MeSH term belongs to a complex tree like hierarchy of terms where
each term can appear multiple times. The immediately surrounding nodes
of the tree are modelled in twigs.

See: L<Bio::Phenotype::MeSH::Twig>.
