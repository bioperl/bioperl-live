=head1 DESCRIPTION

This interface defines the functions one can expect for any object
wanting to use database cross-references. This class does not actually
provide any implementation, it just provides the definitions of what
methods one can call.

The database cross-references are implemented as L<Bio::Annotation::DBLink>
objects.
