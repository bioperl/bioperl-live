=head1 NAME

Bio::PullParserI - A base module for fast 'pull' parsing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # do not use this class, it is intended for parser module
    # writers only

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you are writing a module to parse some new format, you may wish to use
a 'pull' approach whereby you only do work (reading file data, parsing it,
turning the parsed data in an object) when absolutely necessary.

PullParserI provides a system for doing exactly that. As a PullParser you
need a chunk. A chunk is just a Bio::Root::IO that contains all the raw data
you would want to parse. You can use the chunk() method to create a chunk from
a filename, existing filehandle or even a string. If you make a chunk from a
large file, but actually only want your chunk to be some portion of the whole
file, supply start and end amounts in bytes to chunk() at the same time.
The methods _chunk_seek() and _chunk_tell() provide seeks and tells that are
relative to the start and end of your chunk, not the whole file.

The other thing you will need to decide when making a chunk is how to handle
piped input. A PullParser typically needs seekable data to parse, so if your
data is piped in and unseekable, you must decide between creating a temp file
or reading the input into memory, which will be done before the chunk becomes
usable and you can begin any parsing. Alternatively you can choose to force
a sequential read, in which case you can make use of _dependencies() to define
the linear order of methods that would result in the file being read
sequentially. The return value of _sequential() is also useful here, if you
would need to cache some data or otherwise behave differently during a
sequential read.

The main method in the system is get_field(). This method relies on the
existance of a private hash reference accessible to it with the method
_fields(). That hash ref should have as keys all the sorts of data you will want
to parse (eg. 'score'), and prior to parsing the values would be undefined. A
user of your module can then call either $module-E<gt>get_field('score') or
$module-E<gt>score and get_field will either return the answer from
$self-E<gt>_fields-E<gt>{score} if it is defined, or call a method _discover_score()
first if not. So for the system to work you need to define a _discover_*()
method for every field in the fields hash, and ensure that the method stores an
answer in the fields hash.

How you implement your _discover_* methods is up to you, though you should never
call a _discover_* method directly yourself; always use get_field(), since
get_field() will deal with calling dependent methods for you if a forced
sequenctial read is in progress due to piped input. You will almost certainly
want to make use of the various chunk-related methods of this class (that are
denoted private by the leading '_'; this means you can use them as the author of
a parser class, but users of your parser should not). 

Primary amongst them is _*_chunk_by_end() to which you provide text that
represents the end of your desired chunk and it does a readline with your
argument as $/. The chunk knows about its line-endings, so if you want your
end definition to include a new line, just always use "\n" and PullParserI will
do any necessary conversion for you.

If your input data is hierarchical (eg. report-E<gt>many results-E<gt>many hits-E<gt>many
hsps), and you want an object at the leaf of the hierarchy to have access to
information that is shared amongst all of them (is parsed in the root), you
don't have to copy the data to each leaf object; simply by defining parent(),
when you call get_field() and the requested field isn't in your leaf's fields
hash, the leaf's parent will be asked for the field instead, and so on till
root.

See Bio::SearchIO::hmmer_pull for an example of implementing a parser using
PullParserI.

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.

The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods.
Internal methods are usually preceded with a _

=head2 _fields

 Title   : _fields
 Usage   : $obj->_fields( { field1 => undef } );
           my $fields_ref = $obj->_fields;
 Function: Get/set the hash reference containing all the fields for this parser
 Returns : hash ref
 Args    : none to get, OR hash ref to set

=cut

sub _fields {
    my $self = shift;
    if (@_) {
        $self->{_fields} = shift;

=head2 has_field

 Title   : has_field
 Usage   : if ($obj->has_field('field_name') {...}
 Function: Ask if a particular object has a given field (doesn't ask ancestors)
 Returns : boolean
 Args    : string (the field name to test)

=head2 get_field

 Title   : get_field
 Usage   : my $field_value = $obj->get_field('field_name');
 Function: Get the value of a given field. If this $obj doesn't have the field,
           it's parent() will be asked, and so on until there are no more
           parents.
 Returns : scalar, warns if a value for the field couldn't be found and returns
           undef.
 Args    : string (the field to get)

=cut

sub get_field {
    my $self = shift;
    my $desired = shift || return keys %{$self->_fields};
    if (exists $self->_fields->{$desired}) {
        unless (defined $self->_fields->{$desired}) {
            my $method = '_discover_'.$desired;
            
            my $dependency = $self->_dependencies($desired);
            if ($dependency && ! defined $self->_fields->{$dependency}) {
                $self->get_field($dependency);
            }

=head2 parent

 Title   : parent
 Usage   : $obj->parent($parent_obj);
           my $parent_obj = $obj->parent;
 Function: Get/set the parent object of this one.
 Returns : Bio::PullParserI
 Args    : none to get, OR Bio::PullParserI to set

=cut

sub parent {
    my $self = shift;
    if (@_) { $self->{parent} = shift }
    return $self->{parent} || return;
}

=head2 chunk

 Title   : chunk
 Usage   : $obj->chunk($filename);
           my $chunk = $obj->chunk;
 Function: Get/set the chunk of this parser.
 Returns : Bio:Root::IO
 Args    : none to get, OR
           First argument of a GLOB reference, filename string, string data to
           treat as the chunk, or Bio::Root::IO.
           Optionally, also provide:
           -start => int : the byte position within the thing described by the
                           first argument to consider as the start of this
                           chunk (default 0)
           -end   => int : the byte position to consider as the end (default
                           true end)
           -piped_behaviour => 'memory'|'temp_file'|'sequential_read'

           The last option comes into effect when the first argument is
           something that cannot be seeked (eg. piped input filehandle).
            'memory'          means read all the piped input into a string
                              first, then set the chunk to that string.
            'temp_file'       means read all the piped input and output it to
                              a temp file, then set the chunk to that temp file.
            'sequential_read' means that the piped input should be read
                              sequentially and your parsing code must cope with
                              not being able to seek.
           'memory' is the fastest but uses the most memory. 'temp_file' and
           'sequential_read' can be slow, with 'temp_file' being the most memory
           efficient but requiring disc space. The default is 'sequential_read'.
           Note that in versions of perl earlier than 5.8 only temp_file works
           and will be used regardless of what value is supplied here.
