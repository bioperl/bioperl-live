=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Bio::Graphics::Panel class provides drawing and formatting
services for any object that implements the Bio::SeqFeatureI
interface, including Ace::Sequence::Feature and Das::Segment::Feature
objects.  It can be used to draw sequence annotations, physical
(contig) maps, or any other type of map in which a set of discrete
ranges need to be laid out on the number line.

The module supports a drawing style in which each type of feature
occupies a discrete "track" that spans the width of the display.  Each
track will have its own distinctive "glyph", a configurable graphical
representation of the feature.

The module also supports a more flexible style in which several
different feature types and their associated glyphs can occupy the
same track.  The choice of glyph is under run-time control.

Semantic zooming (for instance, changing the type of glyph depending
on the density of features) is supported by a callback system for
configuration variables.  The module has built-in support for Bio::Das
stylesheets, and stylesheet-driven configuration can be intermixed
with semantic zooming, if desired.

You can add a key to the generated image using either of two key
styles.  One style places the key captions at the top of each track.
The other style generates a graphical key at the bottom of the image.

Note that this module depends on GD. The optional SVG output depends
on GD::SVG and SVG.

=head1 METHODS

This section describes the class and object methods for
Bio::Graphics::Panel.

Typically you will begin by creating a new Bio::Graphics::Panel
object, passing it the desired width of the image to generate and an
origin and length describing the coordinate range to display.  The
Bio::Graphics::Panel-E<gt>new() method has may configuration variables
that allow you to control the appearance of the image.

You will then call add_track() one or more times to add sets of
related features to the picture.  add_track() places a new horizontal
track on the image, and is likewise highly configurable.  When you
have added all the features you desire, you may call png() to convert
the image into a PNG-format image, or boxes() to return coordinate
information that can be used to create an imagemap.

=head2 CONSTRUCTORS

new() is the constructor for Bio::Graphics::Panel:

=over 4

=item $panel = Bio::Graphics::Panel-E<gt>new(@options)

The new() method creates a new panel object.  The options are
a set of tag/value pairs as follows:

  Option      Value                                  Default
  ------      -----                                  -------

  -offset     Base pair to place at extreme left     none
	      of image, in zero-based coordinates

  -length     Length of sequence segment, in bp      none

  -start      Start of range, in 1-based             none
              coordinates.

  -stop       Stop of range, in 1-based              none
	      coordinates.

  -end        Same as -stop.

  -segment    A Bio::SeqI or Das::Segment            none
              object, used to derive sequence
	      range if not otherwise specified.

  -width      Desired width of image, in pixels      600

  -spacing    Spacing between tracks, in pixels      5

  -pad_top    Additional whitespace between top      0
	      of image and contents, in pixels

  -pad_bottom Additional whitespace between top      0
	      of image and bottom, in pixels

  -pad_left   Additional whitespace between left     0
	      of image and contents, in pixels

  -pad_right  Additional whitespace between right    0
	      of image and bottom, in pixels

  -bgcolor    Background color for the panel as a    white
	      whole

  -key_color  Background color for the key printed   wheat
              at bottom of panel (if any)

  -key_spacing Spacing between key glyphs in the     10
               key printed at bottom of panel
               (if any)

  -key_font    Font to use in printed key            gdMediumBoldFont
	       captions.

  -key_style   Whether to print key at bottom of     none
	       panel ("bottom"), between each
	       track ("between"), to the left of
               each track ("left"), to the right
               of each track ("right") or
               not at all ("none").

  -empty_tracks What to do when a track is empty.    suppress
              Options are to suppress the track
              completely ("suppress"), to show just
              the key in "between" mode ("key"),
              to draw a thin grey line ("line"),
              or to draw a dashed line ("dashed").

  -flip       flip the drawing coordinates left     false
              to right, so that lower coordinates
              are to the right.  This can be
              useful for drawing (-) strand
              features.

  -all_callbacks Whether to invoke callbacks on      false
               the automatic "track" and "group"
               glyphs.

  -grid        Whether to draw a vertical grid in    false
               the background.  Pass a scalar true
               value to have a grid drawn at
               regular intervals (corresponding
               to the minor ticks of the arrow
	       glyph).  Pass an array reference
               to draw the grid at the specified
               positions.

  -gridcolor   Color of the grid                     lightcyan

  -image_class To create output in scalable vector
               graphics (SVG), optionally pass the image
               class parameter 'GD::SVG'. Defaults to
               using vanilla GD. See the corresponding
               image_class() method below for details.

  -link, -title, -target
               These options are used when creating imagemaps
               for display on the web.  See L</"Creating Imagemaps">.

Typically you will pass new() an object that implements the
Bio::RangeI interface, providing a length() method, from which the
panel will derive its scale.

  $panel = Bio::Graphics::Panel->new(-segment => $sequence,
				     -width   => 800);

new() will return undef in case of an error.

Note that if you use the "left" or "right" key styles, you are
responsible for allocating sufficient -pad_left or -pad_right room for
the labels to appear.  The necessary width is the number of characters
in the longest key times the font width (gdMediumBoldFont by default)
plus 3 pixels of internal padding.  The simplest way to calculate this
is to iterate over the possible track labels, find the largest one,
and then to compute its width using the formula:

  $width = gdMediumBoldFont->width * length($longest_key) +3;

In order to obtain scalable vector graphics (SVG) output, you should
pass new() the -image_class=E<gt>'GD::SVG' parameter. This will cause
Bio::Graphics::Panel to load the optional GD::SVG module. See the gd()
and svg() methods below for additional information.

=head2 OBJECT METHODS

=over 4

=item $track = $panel-E<gt>add_track($glyph,$features,@options)

The add_track() method adds a new track to the image. 

Tracks are horizontal bands which span the entire width of the panel.
Each track contains a number of graphical elements called "glyphs",
corresponding to a sequence feature. 

There are a large number of glyph types.  By default, each track will
be homogeneous on a single glyph type, but you can mix several glyph
types on the same track by providing a code reference to the -glyph
argument.  Other options passed to add_track() control the color and
size of the glyphs, whether they are allowed to overlap, and other
formatting attributes.  The height of a track is determined from its
contents and cannot be directly influenced.

The first two arguments are the glyph name and an array reference
containing the list of features to display.  The order of the
arguments is irrelevant, allowing either of these idioms:

  $panel->add_track(arrow => \@features);
  $panel->add_track(\@features => 'arrow');


The glyph name indicates how each feature is to be rendered.  A
variety of glyphs are available, and the number is growing. You may
omit the glyph name entirely by providing a B<-glyph> argument among
@options, as described below.

Currently, the following glyphs are available:

  Name        Description
  ----        -----------

  anchored_arrow
              a span with vertical bases |---------|.  If one or
              the other end of the feature is off-screen, the base
              will be replaced by an arrow.

  arrow	      An arrow; can be unidirectional or bidirectional.
	      It is also capable of displaying a scale with
	      major and minor tickmarks, and can be oriented
	      horizontally or vertically.

  cds         Draws CDS features, using the phase information to
              show the reading frame usage.  At high magnifications
              draws the protein translation.

  crossbox    A box with a big "X" inside it.

  diamond     A diamond, useful for point features like SNPs.

  dna         At high magnification draws the DNA sequence.  At
              low magnifications draws the GC content.

  dot         A circle, useful for point features like SNPs, stop
              codons, or promoter elements.

  ellipse     An oval.

  extending_arrow
              Similar to arrow, but a dotted line indicates when the
              feature extends beyond the end of the canvas.

  generic     A filled rectangle, nondirectional.

  graded_segments
              Similar to segments, but the intensity of the color
              is proportional to the score of the feature.  This
              is used for showing the intensity of blast hits or
              other alignment features.

  group	      A group of related features connected by a dashed line.
	      This is used internally by Panel.

  heterogeneous_segments
              Like segments, but you can use the source field of the feature
              to change the color of each segment.

  line        A simple line.

  pinsertion  A triangle designed to look like an insertion location
              (e.g. a transposon insertion).

  processed_transcript  multi-purpose representation of a spliced mRNA, including
			positions of UTRs

  primers     Two inward pointing arrows connected by a line.
	      Used for STSs.

  redgreen_box A box that changes from green->yellow->red as the score
              of the feature increases from 0.0 to 1.0.  Useful for
              representing microarray results.

  rndrect     A round-cornered rectangle.

  segments    A set of filled rectangles connected by solid lines.
	      Used for interrupted features, such as gapped
	      alignments.

  ruler_arrow An arrow with major and minor tick marks and interval
              labels.

  toomany     Tries to show many features as a cloud.  Not very successful.

  track	      A group of related features not connected by a line.
	      This is used internally by Panel.

  transcript  Similar to segments, but the connecting line is
	      a "hat" shape, and the direction of transcription
	      is indicated by a small arrow.

  transcript2  Similar to transcript, but the direction of
              transcription is indicated by a terminal exon
              in the shape of an arrow.

  translation 1, 2 and 3-frame translations.  At low magnifications,
              can be configured to show start and stop codon locations.
              At high magnifications, shows the multi-frame protein
              translation.

  triangle    A triangle whose width and orientation can be altered.

  xyplot      Histograms and other graphs plotted against the genome.

If the glyph name is omitted from add_track(), the "generic" glyph
will be used by default.  To get more information about a glyph, run
perldoc on "Bio::Graphics::Glyph::glyphname", replacing "glyphname"
with the name of the glyph you are interested in.

The @options array is a list of name/value pairs that control the
attributes of the track.  Some options are interpretered directly by
the track.  Others are passed down to the individual glyphs (see
L<"GLYPH OPTIONS">).  The following options are track-specific:

  Option      Description                  Default
  ------      -----------                  -------

  -tkcolor    Track color                  white

  -glyph      Glyph class to use.         "generic"

  -stylesheet Bio::Das::Stylesheet to     none
              use to generate glyph
	      classes and options.

B<-tkcolor> controls the background color of the track as a whole.

B<-glyph> controls the glyph type.  If present, it supersedes the
glyph name given in the first or second argument to add_track().  The
value of B<-glyph> may be a constant string, a hash reference, or a
code reference.  In the case of a constant string, that string will be
used as the class name for all generated glyphs.  If a hash reference
is passed, then the feature's primary_tag() will be used as the key to
the hash, and the value, if any, used to generate the glyph type.  If
a code reference is passed, then this callback will be passed each
feature in turn as its single argument.  The callback is expected to
examine the feature and return a glyph name as its single result.

Example:

  $panel->add_track(\@exons,
		    -glyph => sub { my $feature = shift;
                                    $feature->source_tag eq 'curated'
                                          ? 'ellipse' : 'generic'; }
                    );

The B<-stylesheet> argument is used to pass a Bio::Das stylesheet
object to the panel.  This stylesheet will be called to determine both
the glyph and the glyph options.  If both a stylesheet and direct
options are provided, the latter take precedence.

If successful, add_track() returns an Bio::Graphics::Glyph object.
You can use this object to add additional features or to control the
appearance of the track with greater detail, or just ignore it.
Tracks are added in order from the top of the image to the bottom.  To
add tracks to the top of the image, use unshift_track().

B<Adding groups of features:> It is not uncommon to add a group of
features which are logically connected, such as the 5' and 3' ends of
EST reads.  To group features into sets that remain on the same
horizontal position and bump together, pass the sets as an anonymous
array.  For example:

  $panel->add_track(segments => [[$abc_5,$abc_3],
				 [$xxx_5,$xxx_3],
				 [$yyy_5,$yyy_3]]
		    );

Typical usage is:

 $panel->add_track( transcript    => \@genes,
 		    -fillcolor =>  'green',
 		    -fgcolor   =>  'black',
 		    -bump      =>  +1,
 		    -height    => 10,
 		    -label     => 1);

=item $track = unshift_track($glyph,$features,@options)

unshift_track() works like add_track(), except that the new track is
added to the top of the image rather than the bottom.

=item $track = $panel-E<gt>insert_track($position,$glyph,$features,@options)

This works like add_track(), but the track is inserted into the
indicated position.  The track will be inserted B<before> the
indicated position; thus specify a track of 0 to insert the new track
at the beginning.

=item $gd = $panel-E<gt>gd([$gd])

The gd() method lays out the image and returns a GD::Image object
containing it.  You may then call the GD::Image object's png() or
jpeg() methods to get the image data.

Optionally, you may pass gd() a preexisting GD::Image object that you
wish to draw on top of.  If you do so, you should call the width() and
height() methods first to ensure that the image has sufficient
dimensions.

If you passed new() the -image_class=E<gt>'GD::SVG' parameter, the gd() method
returns a GD::SVG::Image object. This object overrides GD::Image
methods in order to generate SVG output. It behaves exactly as
described for GD::Image objects with one exception: it implements and
svg() method instead of the png() or jpeg() methods. Currently there
is no direct access to underlying SVG calls but this is subject to
change in the future.

=item $png = $panel-E<gt>png

The png() method returns the image as a PNG-format drawing, without
the intermediate step of returning a GD::Image object.

=item $svg = $panel-E<gt>svg

The svg() method returns the image in an XML-ified SVG format.

=item $panel-E<gt>finished

Bio::Graphics creates memory cycles.  When you are finished with the
panel, you should call its finished() method.  Otherwise you will have
memory leaks.  This is only an issue if you're going to create several
panels in a single program.

=item $image_class = $panel-E<gt>image_class

The image_class() method returns the current drawing package being
used, currently one of GD or GD::SVG.  This is primarily used
internally to ensure that calls to GD's exported methods are called in
an object-oriented manner to avoid compile time undefined string
errors.  This is usually not needed for external use.

=item $image_package = $panel-E<gt>image_package

This accessor method, like image_class() above is provided as a
convenience.  It returns the current image package in use, currently
one of GD::Image or GD::SVG::Image.  This is not normally used
externally.

=item $polygon_package = $panel-E<gt>polygon_package

This accessor method, like image_package() above is provided as a
convenience.  It returns the current polygon package in use, currently
one of GD::Polygon or GD::SVG::Polygon.  This is not normally used
externally except in the design of glyphs.

=item $boxes = $panel-E<gt>boxes

=item @boxes = $panel-E<gt>boxes

The boxes() method returns the coordinates of each glyph, useful for
constructing an image map.  In a scalar context, boxes() returns an
array ref.  In an list context, the method returns the array directly.

Each member of the list is an anonymous array of the following format:

  [ $feature, $x1, $y1, $x2, $y2, $track ]

The first element is the feature object; either an
Ace::Sequence::Feature, a Das::Segment::Feature, or another Bioperl
Bio::SeqFeatureI object.  The coordinates are the topleft and
bottomright corners of the glyph, including any space allocated for
labels. The track is the Bio::Graphics::Glyph object corresponding
to the track that the feature is rendered inside.

=item $position = $panel-E<gt>track_position($track)

After calling gd() or boxes(), you can learn the resulting Y
coordinate of a track by calling track_position() with the value
returned by add_track() or unshift_track().  This will return undef if
called before gd() or boxes() or with an invalid track.

=item @pixel_coords = $panel-E<gt>location2pixel(@feature_coords)

Public routine to map feature coordinates (in base pairs) into pixel
coordinates relative to the left-hand edge of the picture.

=head1 GLYPH OPTIONS

Each glyph has its own specialized subset of options, but
some are shared by all glyphs:

  Option      Description                  Default
  ------      -----------                  -------

  -fgcolor    Foreground color		   black

  -bgcolor    Background color             turquoise

  -linewidth  Width of lines drawn by	   1
	      glyph

  -height     Height of glyph		   10

  -font       Glyph font		   gdSmallFont

  -fontcolor  Primary font color	   black

  -font2color Secondary font color	   turquoise

  -label      Whether to draw a label	   false

  -description  Whether to draw a          false
              description

  -bump	      Bump direction		   0

  -sort_order Specify layout sort order    "default"

  -bump_limit Maximum number of levels     undef (unlimited)
              to bump

  -hbumppad   Additional horizontal        0
              padding between bumped
              features

  -strand_arrow Whether to indicate        undef (false)
                 strandedness

  -stranded    Synonym for -strand_arrow   undef (false)

  -connector  Type of connector to         none
	      use to connect related
	      features.  Options are
	      "solid," "hat", "dashed", 
              "quill" and "none".

  -key        Description of track for     undef
	      use in key.

  -all_callbacks Whether to invoke         undef
              callbacks for autogenerated
              "track" and "group" glyphs

  -box_subparts Return boxes around feature          false
               subparts rather than around the
               feature itself.

  -link, -title, -target
               These options are used when creating imagemaps
               for display on the web.  See L</"Creating Imagemaps">.

B<Specifying colors:> Colors can be expressed in either of two ways:
as symbolic names such as "cyan" and as HTML-style #RRGGBB triples.
The symbolic names are the 140 colors defined in the Netscape/Internet
Explorer color cube, and can be retrieved using the
Bio::Graphics::Panel-E<gt>color_names() method.

B<Foreground color:> The -fgcolor option controls the foreground
color, including the edges of boxes and the like.

B<Background color:> The -bgcolor option controls the background used
for filled boxes and other "solid" glyphs.  The foreground color
controls the color of lines and strings.  The -tkcolor argument
controls the background color of the entire track.

B<Track color:> The -tkcolor option used to specify the background of
the entire track.

B<Font color:> The -fontcolor option controls the color of primary
text, such as labels

B<Secondary Font color:> The -font2color option controls the color of
secondary text, such as descriptions.

B<Labels:> The -label argument controls whether or not the ID of the
feature should be printed next to the feature.  It is accepted by all
glyphs.  By default, the label is printed just above the glyph and
left aligned with it.  

-label can be a constant string or a code reference.  Values can be
any of:

  -label value     Description
  ------------     -----------

    0              Don't draw a label
    1              Calculate a label based on primary tag of sequence
    "a string"     Use "a string" as the label
    code ref       Invoke the code reference to compute the label

A known bug with this naming scheme is that you can't label a feature
with the string "1".  To work around this, use "1 " (note the terminal 
space).

B<Descriptions:> The -description argument controls whether or not a
brief description of the feature should be printed next to it.  By
default, the description is printed just below the glyph and
left-aligned with it.  A value of 0 will suppress the description.  A
value of 1 will call the source_tag() method of the feature.  A code
reference will be invoked to calculate the description on the fly.
Anything else will be treated as a string and used verbatim.

B<Connectors:> A glyph can contain subglyphs, recursively.  The top
level glyph is the track, which contains one or more groups, which
contain features, which contain subfeatures, and so forth.  By
default, the "group" glyph draws dotted lines between each of its
subglyphs, the "segment" glyph draws a solid line between each of its
subglyphs, and the "transcript" and "transcript2" glyphs draw
hat-shaped lines between their subglyphs.  All other glyphs do not
connect their components.  You can override this behavior by providing 
a -connector option, to explicitly set the type of connector.  Valid
options are:


   "hat"     an upward-angling conector
   "solid"   a straight horizontal connector
   "quill"   a decorated line with small arrows indicating strandedness
             (like the UCSC Genome Browser uses)
   "dashed"  a horizontal dashed line.

The B<-connector_color> option controls the color of the connector, if
any.

B<Collision control:> The B<-bump> argument controls what happens when
glyphs collide.  By default, they will simply overlap (value 0).  A
-bump value of +1 will cause overlapping glyphs to bump downwards
until there is room for them.  A -bump value of -1 will cause
overlapping glyphs to bump upwards.  You may also provide a -bump
value of +2 or -2 to activate a very simple type of collision control
in which each feature occupies its own line.  This is useful for
showing dense, nearly-full length features such as similarity hits.
The bump argument can also be a code reference; see below.

If you would like to see more horizontal whitespace between features
that occupy the same line, you can specify it with the B<-hbumppad>
option.  Positive values increase the amount of whitespace between
features.  Negative values decrease the whitespace.

B<Keys:> The -key argument declares that the track is to be shown in a
key appended to the bottom of the image.  The key contains a picture
of a glyph and a label describing what the glyph means.  The label is
specified in the argument to -key.

B<box_subparts:> Ordinarily, when you invoke the boxes() methods to
retrieve the rectangles surrounding the glyphs (which you need to do
to create clickable imagemaps, for example), the rectangles will
surround the top level features.  If you wish for the rectangles to
surround subpieces of the glyph, such as the exons in a transcript,
set box_subparts to a true value.

B<strand_arrow:> If set to true, some glyphs will indicate their
strandedness, usually by drawing an arrow.  For this to work, the
Bio::SeqFeature must have a strand of +1 or -1.  The glyph will ignore
this directive if the underlying feature has a strand of zero or
undef.

B<sort_order>: By default, features are drawn with a layout based only on the
position of the feature, assuring a maximal "packing" of the glyphs
when bumped.  In some cases, however, it makes sense to display the
glyphs sorted by score or some other comparison, e.g. such that more
"important" features are nearer the top of the display, stacked above
less important features.  The -sort_order option allows a few
different built-in values for changing the default sort order (which
is by "left" position): "low_score" (or "high_score") will cause
features to be sorted from lowest to highest score (or vice versa).
"left" (or "default") and "right" values will cause features to be
sorted by their position in the sequence.  "longer" (or "shorter")
will cause the longest (or shortest) features to be sorted first, and
"strand" will cause the features to be sorted by strand: "+1"
(forward) then "0" (unknown, or NA) then "-1" (reverse).

In all cases, the "left" position will be used to break any ties.  To
break ties using another field, options may be strung together using a
"|" character; e.g. "strand|low_score|right" would cause the features
to be sorted first by strand, then score (lowest to highest), then by
"right" position in the sequence.

Finally, a subroutine coderef with a $$ prototype can be provided.  It
will receive two B<glyph> as arguments and should return -1, 0 or 1
(see Perl's sort() function for more information).  For example, to
sort a set of database search hits by bits (stored in the features'
"score" fields), scaled by the log of the alignment length (with
"start" position breaking any ties):

  sort_order = sub ($$) {
    my ($glyph1,$glyph2) = @_;
    my $a = $glyph1->feature;
    my $b = $glyph2->feature;
    ( $b->score/log($b->length)
          <=>
      $a->score/log($a->length) )
          ||
    ( $a->start <=> $b->start )
  }

It is important to remember to use the $$ prototype as shown in the
example.  Otherwise Bio::Graphics will quit with an exception. The
arguments are subclasses of Bio::Graphics::Glyph, not the features
themselves.  While glyphs implement some, but not all, of the feature
methods, to be safe call the two glyphs' feature() methods in order to
convert them into the actual features.

The '-always_sort' option, if true, will sort features even if bumping
is turned off.  This is useful if you would like overlapping features
to stack in a particular order.  Features towards the end of the list
will overlay those towards the beginning of the sort order.

B<bump_limit>: When bumping is chosen, colliding features will
ordinarily move upward or downward without limit.  When many features
collide, this can lead to excessively high images.  You can limit the
number of levels that features will bump by providing a numeric
B<bump_limit> option.

=head2 Options and Callbacks

Instead of providing a constant value to an option, you may subsitute
a code reference.  This code reference will be called every time the
panel needs to configure a glyph.  The callback will be called with
three arguments like this:

   sub callback {
      my ($feature,$option_name,$part_no,$total_parts,$glyph) = @_;
      # do something which results in $option_value being set
      return $option_value;
   }

The five arguments are C<$feature>, a reference to the IO::SeqFeatureI
object, C<$option_name>, the name of the option to configure,
C<$part_no>, an integer index indicating which subpart of the feature
is being drawn, C<$total_parts>, an integer indicating the total
number of subfeatures in the feature, and finally C<$glyph>, the Glyph
object itself.  The latter fields are useful in the case of treating
the first or last subfeature differently, such as using a different
color for the terminal exon of a gene.  Usually you will only need to
examine the first argument.  This example shows a callback examining
the score() attribute of a feature (possibly a BLAST hit) and return
the color "red" for high-scoring features, and "green" for low-scoring
features:

  sub callback {
     my $feature = shift;
     if ($feature->score > 90) {
       return 'red';
     else {
       return 'green';
    }
  }

The callback should return a string indicating the desired value of
the option.  To tell the panel to use the default value for this
option, return the string "*default*".

When you install a callback for a feature that contains subparts, the
callback will be invoked first for the top-level feature, and then for
each of its subparts (recursively).  You should make sure to examine
the feature's type to determine whether the option is appropriate.

Some glyphs deliberately disable this recursive feature.  The "track",
"group", "transcript", "transcript2" and "segments" glyphs selectively
disable the -bump, -label and -description options.  This is to avoid,
for example, a label being attached to each exon in a transcript, or
the various segments of a gapped alignment bumping each other.  You
can override this behavior and force your callback to be invoked by
providing add_track() with a true B<-all_callbacks> argument.  In this
case, you must be prepared to handle configuring options for the
"group" and "track" glyphs.

In particular, this means that in order to control the -bump option
with a callback, you should specify -all_callbacks=E<gt>1, and turn on
bumping when the callback is in the track or group glyphs.

=head2 ACCESSORS

The following accessor methods provide access to various attributes of
the panel object.  Called with no arguments, they each return the
current value of the attribute.  Called with a single argument, they
set the attribute and return its previous value.

Note that in most cases you must change attributes prior to invoking
gd(), png() or boxes().  These three methods all invoke an internal
layout() method which places the tracks and the glyphs within them,
and then caches the result.

   Accessor Name      Description
   -------------      -----------

   width()	      Get/set width of panel
   spacing()	      Get/set spacing between tracks
   key_spacing()      Get/set spacing between keys
   length()	      Get/set length of segment (bp)
   flip()             Get/set coordinate flipping
   pad_top()	      Get/set top padding
   pad_left()	      Get/set left padding
   pad_bottom()	      Get/set bottom padding
   pad_right()	      Get/set right padding
   start()            Get the start of the sequence (bp; read only)
   end()              Get the end of the sequence (bp; read only)
   left()             Get the left side of the drawing area (pixels; read only)
   right()            Get the right side of the drawing area (pixels; read only)

=head2 COLOR METHODS

The following methods are used internally, but may be useful for those
implementing new glyph types.

=over 4

=item @names = Bio::Graphics::Panel-E<gt>color_names

Return the symbolic names of the colors recognized by the panel
object.  In a scalar context, returns an array reference.

=item ($red,$green,$blue) = Bio::Graphics::Panel-E<gt>color_name_to_rgb($color)

Given a symbolic color name, returns the red, green, blue components
of the color.  In a scalar context, returns an array reference to the
rgb triplet.  Returns undef for an invalid color name.

=item @rgb = $panel-E<gt>rgb($index)

Given a GD color index (between 0 and 140), returns the RGB triplet
corresponding to this index.  This method is only useful within a
glyph's draw() routine, after the panel has allocated a GD::Image and
is populating it.

=item $index = $panel-E<gt>translate_color($color)

Given a color, returns the GD::Image index.  The color may be
symbolic, such as "turquoise", or a #RRGGBB triple, as in #F0E0A8.
This method is only useful within a glyph's draw() routine, after the
panel has allocated a GD::Image and is populating it.

=item $panel-E<gt>set_pen($width,$color)

Changes the width and color of the GD drawing pen to the values
indicated.  This is called automatically by the GlyphFactory fgcolor()
method.  It returns the GD value gdBrushed, which should be used for
drawing.

=back

=head2 Creating Imagemaps

You may wish to use Bio::Graphics to create clickable imagemaps for
display on the web.  The main method for achieving this is
image_and_map().  Under special circumstances you may instead wish to
call either or both of create_web_image() and create_web_map().

Here is a synopsis of how to use image_and_map() in a CGI script,
using CGI.pm calls to provide the HTML scaffolding:

   print h2('My Genome');

   my ($url,$map,$mapname) =
       $panel->image_and_map(-root => '/var/www/html',
                             -url  => '/tmpimages',
                             -link => 'http://www.google.com/search?q=$name');

   print img({-src=>$url,-usemap=>"#$mapname"});

   print $map;

We call image_and_map() with various arguments (described below) to
generate a three element list consisting of the URL at which the image
can be accessed, an HTML fragment containing the clickable imagemap
data, and the name of the map.  We print out an E<lt>imageE<gt> tag
that uses the URL of the map as its src attribute and the name of the
map as the value of its usemap attribute.  It is important to note
that we must put a "#" in front of the name of the map in order to
indicate that the map can be found in the same document as the
E<lt>imageE<gt> tag.  Lastly, we print out the map itself.

=over 4

=item ($url,$map,$mapname) = $panel->image_and_map(@options)

Create the image in a web-accessible directory and return its URL, its
clickable imagemap, and the name of the imagemap.  The following
options are recognized:

 Option        Description
 ------        -----------

 -url          The URL to store the image at.


 -root         The directory path that should be appended to the
               start of -url in order to obtain a physical
               directory path.
 -link         A string pattern or coderef that will be used to
               generate the outgoing hypertext links for the imagemap.

 -title        A string pattern or coderef that will be used to
               generate the "title" tags of each element in the imagemap
               (these appear as popup hint boxes in certain browsers).

 -target       A string pattern or coderef that will be used to
               generate the window target for each element.  This can
               be used to pop up a new window when the user clicks on
               an element.

 -mapname      The name to use for the E<lt>mapE<gt> tag.  If not provided,
               a unique one will be autogenerated for you.

This method returns a three element list consisting of the URL at
which the image has been written to, the imagemap HTML, and the name
of the map.  Usually you will incorporate this information into an
HTML document like so:

  my ($url,$map,$mapname) =
          $panel->image_and_map(-link=>'http://www.google.com/searche?q=$name');
  print qq(<img src="$url" usemap="#$map">),"\n";
  print $map,"\n";

=item $url = $panel->create_web_image($url,$root)

Create the image, write it into the directory indicated by
concatenating $root and $url (i.e. "$root/$url"), and return $url.

=item $map = $panel->create_web_map('mapname',$linkrule,$titlerule,$targetrule)

Create a clickable imagemap named "mapname" using the indicated rules
to generate the hypertext links, the element titles, and the window
targets for the graphical elements.  Return the HTML for the map,
including the enclosing E<lt>mapE<gt> tag itself.

=back

To use this method effectively, you will need a web server and an
image directory in the document tree that is writable by the web
server user.  For example, if your web server's document root is
located at /var/www/html, you might want to create a directory named
"tmpimages" for this purpose:

  mkdir /var/www/html/tmpimages
  chmod 1777 /var/www/html/tmpimages

The 1777 privilege will allow anyone to create files and
subdirectories in this directory, but only the owner of the file will
be able to delete it.

When you call image_and_map(), you must provide it with two vital
pieces of information: the URL of the image directory and the physical
location of the web server's document tree.  In our example, you would
call:

  $panel->image_and_map(-root => '/var/www/html',-url=>'/tmpimages');

If you are working with virtual hosts, you might wish to provide the
hostname:portnumber part of the URL.  This will work just as well:

  $panel->image_and_map(-root => '/var/www/html',
                        -url  => 'http://myhost.com:8080/tmpimages');

If you do not provide the -root argument, the method will try to
figure it out from the DOCUMENT_ROOT environment variable.  If you do
not provide the -url argument, the method will assume "/tmp".

During execution, the image_and_map() method will generate a unique
name for the image using the Digest::MD5 module.  You can get this
module on CPAN and it B<must> be installed in order to use
image_and_map().  The imagename will be a long hexadecimal string such
as "e7457643f12d413f20843d4030c197c6.png".  Its URL will be
/tmpimages/e7457643f12d413f20843d4030c197c6.png, and its physical path
will be /var/www/html/tmpimages/e7457643f12d413f20843d4030c197c6.png

In addition to providing directory information, you must also tell
image_and_map() how to create outgoing links for each graphical
feature, and, optionally, how to create the "hover title" (the popup
yellow box displayed by most modern browsers), and the name of the
window or frame to link to when the user clicks on it.

There are three ways to specify the link destination:

=over 4

=item 1. By configuring one or more tracks with a -link argument.

=item 2. By configuring the panel with a -link argument.

=item 3. By passing a -link argument in the call to image_and_map().

=back

The -link argument can be either a string or a coderef.  If you pass a
string, it will be interpreted as a URL pattern containing runtime
variables.  These variables begin with a dollar sign ($), and are
replaced at run time with the information relating to the selected
annotation.  Recognized variables include:

     $name        The feature's name (display name)
     $id          The feature's id (eg, PK from a database)
     $class       The feature's class (group class)
     $method      The feature's method (same as primary tag)
     $source      The feature's source
     $ref         The name of the sequence segment (chromosome, contig)
                     on which this feature is located
     $description The feature's description (notes)
     $start       The start position of this feature, relative to $ref
     $end         The end position of this feature, relative to $ref
     $segstart    The left end of $ref displayed in the detailed view
     $segend      The right end of $ref displayed in the detailed view

For example, to link each feature to a Google search on the feature's
description, use the argument:

  -link => 'http://www.google.com/search?q=$description'

Be sure to use single quotes around the pattern, or Perl will attempt
to perform variable interpretation before image_and_map() has a chance
to work on it.

You may also pass a code reference to -link, in which case the code
will be called every time a URL needs to be generated for the
imagemap.  The subroutine will be called with two arguments, the
feature and the Bio::Graphics::Panel object, and it should return the
URL to link to, or an empty string if a link is not desired. Here is a
simple example:

  -link => sub {
         my ($feature,$panel) = @_;
         my $type = $feature->primary_tag;
         my $name = $feature->display_name;
         if ($primary_tag eq 'clone') {
            return "http://www.google.com/search?q=$name";
         } else {
            return "http://www.yahoo.com/search?p=$name";
         }

The -link argument cascades. image_and_map() will first look for a
-link option in the track configuration, and if that's not found, it
will look in the Panel configuration (created during
Bio::Graphics::Panel->new). If no -link configuration option is found
in either location, then image_and_map() will use the value of -link
passed in its argument list, if any.

The -title and -target options behave in a similar manner to -link.
-title is used to assign each feature "title" and "alt" attributes.
The "title" attribute is used by many browsers to create a popup hints
box when the mouse hovers over the feature's glyph for a preset length
of time, while the "alt" attribute is used to create navigable menu
items for the visually impaired.  As with -link, you can set the title
by passing either a substitution pattern or a code ref, and the -title
option can be set in the track, the panel, or the method call itself
in that order of priority.

If not provided, image_and_map() will autogenerate its own title in
the form "<method> <display_name> <seqid>:start..end".

The -target option can be used to specify the window or frame that
clicked features will link to.  By default, when the user clicks on a
feature, the loaded URL will replace the current page.  You can modify
this by providing -target with the name of a preexisting or new window
name in order to create effects like popup windows, multiple frames,
popunders and the like.  The value of -target follows the same rules
as -title and -link, including variable substitution and the use of
code refs.

NOTE: Each time you call image_and_map() it will generate a new image
file.  Images that are identical to an earlier one will reuse the same
name, but those that are different, even by one pixel, will result in
the generation of a new image.  If you have limited disk space, you
might wish to check the images directory periodically and remove those
that have not been accessed recently.  The following cron script will
remove image files that haven't been accessed in more than 20 days.
