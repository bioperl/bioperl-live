Bio::Graphics::Glyph::minmax - The minmax glyph

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  See L<Bio::Graphics::Panel> and L<Bio::Graphics::Glyph>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Bio::Graphics::Glyph::graded_segments> and
L<Bio::Graphics::Glyph::xyplot>.  It adds an internal method named
minmax() for calculating the upper and lower boundaries of scored
features, and is not intended for end users.
