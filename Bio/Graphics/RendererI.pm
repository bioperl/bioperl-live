=head1 NAME

Bio::Graphics::RendererI - A renderer for the Bio::Graphics class that
renders Bio::SeqFeature::CollectionI objects onto
Bio::Graphics::Panels using configuration information provided by a
Bio::Graphics::ConfiguratorI.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Get a renderer somehow, called $renderer

 # create a new panel and render contents a feature collection onto it
 my $config = new ConfigIO( $config_file )->getConfig();
 my $features = $data_provider->getCollection();
 my ( $tracks_rendered, $panel ) = $renderer->render( $features, $prefs );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

 Renderer of Bio::SeqFeature::CollectionIs (collections of features)
 onto a Bio::Graphics::Panel using a Bio::Graphics::ConfiguratorI for general and
 track-specific rendering options.

 Title   : render
 Usage   : ( $rendered, $panel ) =
               $renderer->render( $collection, $configurator [, $panel ] );
 Function: Renders the SeqFeatures in the given collection onto a
           Bio::Graphics::Panel (if no panel is given, one will be
           created), using the given Bio::Graphics::ConfiguratorI for general
           and track-specific rendering options.
 Returns : In a scalar context returns the number of tracks rendered.
           In a list context, returns a two-element list containing
           the number of features rendered and the panel.
 Args    : A Bio::SeqFeature::CollectionI and a Bio::Graphics::ConfiguratorI
           and optionally a Bio::Graphics::Panel.
 Status  : Public
