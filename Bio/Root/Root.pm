=head1 NAME

Bio::Root::Root - Hash-based implementation of Bio::Root::RootI

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Any Bioperl-compliant object is a RootI compliant object

  # Here's how to throw and catch an exception using the eval-based syntax.

  $obj->throw("This is an exception");

  eval {
      $obj->throw("This is catching an exception");
  };

  if( $@ ) {
      print "Caught exception";
  } else {
      print "no exception";
  }

  # Alternatively, using the new typed exception syntax in the throw() call:

  $obj->throw( -class => 'Bio::Root::BadParameter',
               -text  => "Can not open file $file",
               -value  => $file );

  # Want to see debug() outputs for this object

  my $obj = Bio::Object->new(-verbose=>1);

  my $obj = Bio::Object->new(%args);
  $obj->verbose(2);

  # Print debug messages which honour current verbosity setting

  $obj->debug("Boring output only to be seen if verbose > 0\n");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a hashref-based implementation of the Bio::Root::RootI
interface.  Most Bioperl objects should inherit from this.

See the documentation for L<Bio::Root::RootI> for most of the methods
implemented by this module.  Only overridden methods are described
here.

=head2 Throwing Exceptions

One of the functionalities that L<Bio::Root::RootI> provides is the
ability to L<throw>() exceptions with pretty stack traces. Bio::Root::Root
enhances this with the ability to use L<Error> (available from CPAN)
if it has also been installed. 

If L<Error> has been installed, L<throw>() will use it. This causes an
Error.pm-derived object to be thrown. This can be caught within a
C<catch{}> block, from wich you can extract useful bits of
information. If L<Error> is not installed, it will use the 
L<Bio::Root::RootI>-based exception throwing facilty.

=head2 Typed Exception Syntax 

The typed exception syntax of L<throw>() has the advantage of plainly
indicating the nature of the trouble, since the name of the class
is included in the title of the exception output.

To take advantage of this capability, you must specify arguments
as named parameters in the L<throw>() call. Here are the parameters:

=over 4

=item -class

name of the class of the exception.
This should be one of the classes defined in L<Bio::Root::Exception>,
or a custom error of yours that extends one of the exceptions
defined in L<Bio::Root::Exception>.

=item -text

a sensible message for the exception

=item -value

the value causing the exception or $!, if appropriate.

=back

Note that Bio::Root::Exception does not need to be imported into
your module (or script) namespace in order to throw exceptions
via Bio::Root::Root::throw(), since Bio::Root::Root imports it.

=head2 Try-Catch-Finally Support

In addition to using an eval{} block to handle exceptions, you can
also use a try-catch-finally block structure if L<Error> has been
installed in your system (available from CPAN).  See the documentation
for Error for more details.

Here's an example. See the L<Bio::Root::Exception> module for 
other pre-defined exception types:

   try {
    open( IN, $file) || $obj->throw( -class => 'Bio::Root::FileOpenException',
                                     -text => "Cannot open file $file for reading",
                                     -value => $!);
   }
   catch Bio::Root::BadParameter with {
       my $err = shift;   # get the Error object
       # Perform specific exception handling code for the FileOpenException
   }
   catch Bio::Root::Exception with {
       my $err = shift;   # get the Error object
       # Perform general exception handling code for any Bioperl exception.
   }
   otherwise {
       # A catch-all for any other type of exception
   }
   finally {
       # Any code that you want to execute regardless of whether or not
       # an exception occurred.
   };  
   # the ending semicolon is essential!

=head1 FEEDBACK

=head2 Mailing Lists

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this
and other Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably
to one of the Bioperl mailing lists.

Your participation is much appreciated.

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.

=head2 Reporting Bugs

=head2 clone

 Title   : clone
 Usage   : my $clone = $obj->clone();
           or
           my $clone = $obj->clone( -start => 110 );
 Function: Deep recursion copying of any object via Storable dclone()
 Returns : A cloned object.
 Args    : Any named parameters provided will be set on the new object.
           Unnamed parameters are ignored.
 Comments: Where possible, faster clone methods are used, in order:
           Clone::clone(), Storable::dclone.  If neither is present,
           a pure perl fallback (not very well tested) is used instead.
           Storable dclone() cannot clone CODE references.  Therefore, 
           any CODE reference in your original object will remain, but
           will not exist in the cloned object.  
           This should not be used for anything other than cloning of simple
           objects. Developers of subclasses are encouraged to override this
           method with one of their own.

=head2 _dclone

 Title   : clone
 Usage   : my $clone = $obj->_dclone($ref);
           or
           my $clone = $obj->_dclone($ref);
 Function: Returns a copy of the object passed to it (a deep clone)
 Returns : clone of passed argument
 Args    : Anything
 NOTE    : This differs from clone significantly in that it does not clone
           self, but the data passed to it.  This code may need to be optimized
           or overridden as needed.
 Comments: This is set in the BEGIN block to take advantage of optimized
           cloning methods if Clone or Storable is present, falling back to a
           pure perl kludge. May be moved into a set of modules if the need
           arises. At the moment, code ref cloning is not supported.

=head2 verbose

 Title   : verbose
 Usage   : $self->verbose(1)
 Function: Sets verbose level for how ->warn behaves
           -1 = no warning
            0 = standard, small warning
            1 = warning with stack trace
            2 = warning becomes throw
 Returns : The current verbosity setting (integer between -1 to 2)
 Args    : -1,0,1 or 2

=head2 throw

 Title   : throw
 Usage   : $obj->throw("throwing exception message");
           or
           $obj->throw( -class => 'Bio::Root::Exception',
                        -text  => "throwing exception message",
                        -value => $bad_value  );
 Function: Throws an exception, which, if not caught with an eval or
           a try block will provide a nice stack trace to STDERR 
           with the message.
           If Error.pm is installed, and if a -class parameter is
           provided, Error::throw will be used, throwing an error 
           of the type specified by -class.
           If Error.pm is installed and no -class parameter is provided
           (i.e., a simple string is given), A Bio::Root::Exception 
           is thrown.
 Returns : n/a
 Args    : A string giving a descriptive error message, optional
           Named parameters:
           '-class'  a string for the name of a class that derives 
                     from Error.pm, such as any of the exceptions 
                     defined in Bio::Root::Exception.
                     Default class: Bio::Root::Exception
           '-text'   a string giving a descriptive error message
           '-value'  the value causing the exception, or $! (optional)

           Thus, if only a string argument is given, and Error.pm is available,
           this is equivalent to the arguments:
                 -text  => "message",
                 -class => Bio::Root::Exception
 Comments : If Error.pm is installed, and you don't want to use it
            for some reason, you can block the use of Error.pm by
            Bio::Root::Root::throw() by defining a scalar named
            $main::DONT_USE_ERROR (define it in your main script
            and you don't need the main:: part) and setting it to 
            a true value; you must do this within a BEGIN subroutine.
