=head1 NAME

Bio::GloballyIdentifiableI - interface for objects with B<globally
unique> identifiers.

=head1 SYNOPSIS


    # to test this is a *globally* identifiable object

    $obj->isa("Bio::GloballyIdentifiableI") || 
      $obj->throw("$obj does not implement the Bio::GloballyIdentifiableI interface");

    # accessors

    $unique_id = $obj->unique_id(); # by default gives authority:namespace:object_id

    $object_id = $obj->object_id();
    $namespace = $obj->namespace();
    $authority = $obj->authority();
    $version   = $obj->version();

    # utility functions
    $lsid        = $obj->lsid_string();      # gives authority:namespace:object_id
    $ns_string   = $obj->namespace_string(); # gives namespace:object_id.version


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Objects implementing Bio::GloballyIdentifiableI guarantee that the
string returned by the unique_id() method is B<globally unique> --
that is, another person at another time in another country could use
that string to reconstitute the object.

This interface describes methods expected on globally identifiable objects, ie
ones which have identifiers expected to make sense across a number of
instances and/or domains. This interface is modeled after pretty much
ubiquitous ideas for names in bioinformatics being 

 databasename:object_id.version

examples being

 swissprot:P012334.2

or

 GO:0007048

We also work well with LSID proposals which adds in the concept of an
authority, being the DNS name of the organisation assigning the namespace.
Helper functions are provided to make useful strings being


  lsid_string - string complying to the LSID standard
  namespace_string - string complying to the usual convention of 
     namespace:object_id.version

Note: An object that implements Bio::GloballyIdentifiable that is
unable to provide a globally unique identifier B<must> return undef
from its unique_id() method.

=head1 Implementation Specific Functions

These functions are the ones that a specific implementation must
define.

=head2 object_id

 Title   : object_id
 Usage   : $string    = $obj->object_id()
 Function: a string which represents the stable primary identifier
           in this namespace of this object. For DNA sequences this
           is its accession_number, similarly for protein sequences

 Returns : A scalar
 Status  : Virtual

=cut

sub object_id {
  shift->throw_not_implemented( @_ );
}

=head2 version

 Title   : version
 Usage   : $version    = $obj->version()
 Function: a number which differentiates between versions of
           the same object. Higher numbers are considered to be
           later and more relevant, but a single object described
           the same identifier should represent the same concept

 Returns : A number
 Status  : Virtual

=cut

sub version {
  shift->throw_not_implemented( @_ );
}


=head2 authority

 Title   : authority
 Usage   : $authority    = $obj->authority()
 Function: a string which represents the organisation which
           granted the namespace, written as the DNS name for  
           organisation (eg, wormbase.org)

 Returns : A scalar
 Status  : Virtual

=cut

sub authority {
  shift->throw_not_implemented( @_ );
}


=head2 namespace

 Title   : namespace
 Usage   : $string    = $obj->namespace()
 Function: A string representing the name space this identifier
           is valid in, often the database name or the name
           describing the collection 

 Returns : A scalar
 Status  : Virtual

=cut

sub namespace {
  shift->throw_not_implemented( @_ );
}

=head2 unique_id

 Title   : unique_id
 Usage   : $string = $obj->unique_id()
 Function: Return a B<globally unique> identifier for this object
 Returns : A string that uniquely identifies this object everywhere,
           forever, really; or undef if none exists.
 Status  : Public

Note that an object that implements Bio::GloballyIdentifiable that is
unable to provide a (guaranteed to be globally unique) identifier
B<must> return undef from its unique_id() method.

  This method is implemented in the interface to call lsid_string().
  Override if different functionality is desired.

=cut

sub unique_id {
  return shift->lsid_string( @_ );
}



=head1 Implementation optional functions

These functions are helper functions that are provided by
the interface but can be overridden if so wished

=head2 lsid_string

 Title   : lsid_string
 Usage   : $string   = $obj->lsid_string()
 Function: a string which gives the LSID standard
           notation for the identifier of interest


 Returns : A scalar

=cut

## TODO: Allow setting..
sub lsid_string {
  my ($self) = @_;

  return $self->authority.":".$self->namespace.":".$self->object_id;
}

=head2 namespace_string

 Title   : namespace_string
 Usage   : $string   = $obj->namespace_string()
 Function: a string which gives the common notation of
           namespace:object_id.version

 Returns : A scalar

=cut

sub namespace_string {
  my ($self) = @_;

  return $self->namespace.":".$self->object_id .
      (defined($self->version()) ? ".".$self->version : '');
}

1;
