=head1 NAME

Bio::Tools::Blast::Sbjct.pm - Bioperl BLAST "Hit" object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 Object Creation

The construction of HSP objects is handled by B<Bio::Tools::Blast.pm>.
You should not need to use this package directly. See L<_initialize>()
for a description of constructor parameters.

    require Bio::Tools::Blast::Sbjct;
 
    $hit = new Bio::Tools::Blast::Sbjct (-DATA    =>\@hitData, 
					 -PARENT  =>$self, 
					 -NAME    =>5,
					 -RANK    =>5,
					 -RANK_BY =>'order',
					 -MAKE    =>'query' (or 'sbjct'),
					 -OVERLAP =>2,
					 -PROGRAM =>'TBLASTN'
					 );

@hitData includes the summary line for the hit as element [0], plus 
all lines from the HSP alignment section of the BLAST report for
the present hit. 

=head1 INSTALLATION

This module is included with the central Bioperl distribution:

   http://bio.perl.org/Core/Latest
   ftp://bio.perl.org/pub/DIST

Follow the installation instructions included in the README file.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Bio::Tools::Blast::Sbjct.pm module encapsulates data and methods for 
parsing and manipulating "hits" from a BLAST report.
This module is a utility module used by the Bio::Tools::Blast.pm
and is not intended for separate use.

In Blast lingo, the "sbjct" sequences are all the sequences 
in a target database which were compared against a "query" sequence.
The terms "sbjct" and "hit" will be used interchangeably in this and related modules. 

This module supports BLAST versions 1.x and 2.x, gapped and ungapped.

=head2 HSP Tiling and Ambiguous Alignments

If a Blast hit has more than one HSP, the Bio::Tools::Blast::Sbjct.pm object has
the ability to merge overlapping HSPs into contiguous blocks. This permits the Sbjct object
to sum data across all HSPs without counting data in the overlapping regions 
multiple times, which would happen if data from each overlapping HSP are simply summed. 
HSP tiling is performed automatically when methods of the Sbjct object that rely on 
tiled data are invoked. These include L<frac_identical>(), L<frac_conserved>(), L<gaps>(),
L<frac_aligned_query>(), L<frac_aligned_hit>(), L<num_unaligned_query>(), L<num_unaligned_hit>().

It also permits the assessment of an "ambiguous alignment" if the query (or sbjct)
sequences from different HSPs overlap. The existence of an overlap could indicate a
biologically interesting region in the sequence, such as a repeated domain.
The Sbjct object uses the -OVERLAP parameter to determine when two sequences overlap; 
if this is set to 2 -- the default -- then any two sbjct or query HSP sequences 
must overlap by more than two residues to get merged into the same contig and counted
as an overlap. See the L<BUGS> section below for "issues" with HSP tiling.

The results of the HSP tiling is reported with the following ambiguity codes:

   'q' = Query sequence contains multiple sub-sequences matching
         a single region in the sbjct sequence. 
 
   's' = Sbjct sequence contains multiple sub-sequences matching
         a single region in the query sequence. 
 
   'qs' = Both query and sbjct sequences contain more than one
          sub-sequence with similarity to the other sequence.

For addition information about ambiguous BLAST alignments, see
L<_tile_hsps>() and 

 http://www-genome.stanford.edu/Sacch3D/help/ambig_aln.html

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Bio::Tools::Blast::Sbjct.pm is a concrete class that inherits from B<Bio::Root::Object.pm>
and relies on two other modules:

=over 4

=item B<Bio::Tools::Blast::HSP.pm> 

Encapsulates a single high-scoring segment pair within a hit.

=item B<Bio::Tools::Blast.pm>

Provides a container for Sbjct.pm objects.

=back

Bio::Tools::Blast::Sbjct.pm does not currently inherit from Bio::Root::Vector.pm
since Bio::Root::Vector.pm may be re-designed to make it usable via delegation.
Thus, a Blast.pm object would manage a vector of Sbjct.pm objects.
Stay tuned.

=head1 BUGS

One consequence of the HSP tiling is that methods that rely on HSP tiling such as
L<frac_identical>(), L<frac_conserved>(), L<gaps>() etc. may report misleading numbers 
when C<-OVERLAP> is set to a large number.
For example, say we have two HSPs and the query sequence tile as follows:

            1      8             22      30        40             60 
 Full seq:  ------------------------------------------------------------
                    *  ** *   **
 HSP1:             ---------------                    (6 identical matches)
                              **   **  **
 HSP2:                        -------------           (6 identical matches)

If C<-OVERLAP> is set to some number over 4, HSP1 and HSP2 will not be tiled into a single
contig and their numbers of identical matches will be added, giving a total of 12,
not 10 if they had be combined into one contig. This can lead to number greater than 1.0 for
methods L<frac_identical>() and L<frac_conserved>(). This is less of an issue with gapped 
Blast since it tends to combine HSPs that would be listed separately without gapping.
(Fractions E<gt>1.0 can be viewed as a signal for an interesting alignment that warrants 
further inspection, thus turning this bug into a feature).

Using large values for C<-OVERLAP> can lead to incorrect numbers reported by methods that
rely on HSP tiling but can be useful if you care more about detecting ambiguous alignments. 
Setting C<-OVERLAP> to zero will lead to the most accurate numbers for the tiling-dependent
methods but will be useless for detecting overlapping HSPs since all HSPs will appear to
overlap.

=head2 _tile_hsps

 Usage     : n/a; called automatically during object construction or
           : as needed by methods that rely on having tiled data.
 Purpose   : Collect statistics about the aligned sequences in a set of HSPs.
           : Calculates the following data across all HSPs: 
           :    -- total alignment length 
           :    -- total identical residues 
           :    -- total conserved residues
 Returns   : n/a
 Argument  : n/a
 Throws    : n/a
 Status    : Experimental
 Comments  :
           : This method performs more careful summing of data across
           : all HSPs in the Sbjct object. Simply summing the data from all HSPs
           : will overestimate the actual length of the alignment if there is 
           : overlap between different HSPs (often the case).
           : The strategy is to tile the HSPs and sum over the
           : contigs, collecting data separately from overlapping and
           : non-overlapping regions of each HSP. To facilitate this, the
           : HSP.pm object now permits extraction of data from sub-sections
           : of an HSP.
           : 
           : Additional useful information is collected from the results
           : of the tiling. It is possible that sub-sequences in
           : different HSPs will overlap significantly. In this case, it
           : is impossible to create a single unambiguous alignment by
           : concatenating the HSPs. The ambiguity may indicate the
           : presence of multiple, similar domains in one or both of the
           : aligned sequences. This ambiguity is recorded using the
           : ambiguous_aln() method.
           : 
           : This method does not attempt to discern biologically
           : significant vs. insignificant overlaps. The allowable amount of 
           : overlap can be set with the overlap() method or with the -OVERLAP
           : parameter used when constructing the Blast & Sbjct objects. 
           : 
           : For a given hit, both the query and the sbjct sequences are
           : tiled independently.
           : 
           :    -- If only query sequence HSPs overlap, 
           :          this may suggest multiple domains in the sbjct.
           :    -- If only sbjct sequence HSPs overlap, 
           :          this may suggest multiple domains in the query.
           :    -- If both query & sbjct sequence HSPs overlap, 
           :          this suggests multiple domains in both.
           :    -- If neither query & sbjct sequence HSPs overlap, 
           :          this suggests either no multiple domains in either
           :          sequence OR that both sequences have the same
           :          distribution of multiple similar domains.
           : 
           : This method can deal with the special case of when multiple
           : HSPs exactly overlap.
           : 
           : Efficiency concerns:
           :  Speed will be an issue for sequences with numerous HSPs.
           : 
 Bugs      : Currently, _tile_hsps() does not properly account for
           : the number of non-tiled but overlapping HSPs, which becomes a problem
           : as overlap() grows. Large values overlap() may thus lead to 
           : incorrect statistics for some hits. For best results, keep overlap()
           : below 5 (DEFAULT IS 2). For more about this, see the "HSP Tiling and
           : Ambiguous Alignments" section.

 Argument  : format: string of 'raw' | 'exp' | 'parts'
           :    'raw' returns value given in report. Default. (1.2e-34)
           :    'exp' returns exponent value only (34)

 Throws    : n/a
 Status    : Deprecated. Use p() or expect().
 Comments  : The signif() method provides a way to deal with the fact that
           : Blast1 and Blast2 formats differ in what is reported in the
           : description lines of each hit in the Blast report. The signif()

           : both Blast1 and Blast2 reports. This is not necessarily a good thing, since
           : one should always know when one is working with P-values or
           : Expect values (hence the deprecated status).

=head2 Data Members

Information about the various data members of this module is provided for those 
wishing to modify or understand the code. Two things to bear in mind: 

=over 4

=item 1 Do NOT rely on these in any code outside of this module. 

All data members are prefixed with an underscore to signify that they are private.
Always use accessor methods. If the accessor doesn't exist or is inadequate, 
create or modify an accessor (and let me know, too!). (An exception to this might
be for HSP.pm which is more tightly coupled to Sbjct.pm and
may access Sbjct data members directly for efficiency purposes, but probably 
should not).

=item 2 This documentation may be incomplete and out of date.

It is easy for these data member descriptions to become obsolete as 
this module is still evolving. Always double check this info and search 
for members not described here.

=back

An instance of Bio::Tools::Blast::Sbjct.pm is a blessed reference to a hash containing
all or some of the following fields:

 FIELD           VALUE
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 _hsps          : Array ref for a list of Bio::Tools::Blast::HSP.pm objects.
		:
 _db            : Database identifier from the summary line.
		:
 _desc          : Description data for the hit from the summary line.
		:
 _length        : Total length of the hit sequence. 
		:
 _score         : BLAST score.
		:
 _bits          : BLAST score (in bits). Matrix-independent.
		:
 _p             : BLAST P value. Obtained from summary section. (Blast1/WU-Blast only)
		:
 _expect        : BLAST Expect value. Obtained from summary section.
		:
 _n             : BLAST N value (number of HSPs) (Blast1/WU-Blast2 only)
		:
 _frame         : Reading frame for TBLASTN and TBLASTX analyses.
		:
 _totalIdentical: Total number of identical aligned monomers.
		:
 _totalConserved: Total number of conserved aligned monomers (a.k.a. "positives").
		:
 _overlap       : Maximum number of overlapping residues between adjacent HSPs
		: before considering the alignment to be ambiguous.
