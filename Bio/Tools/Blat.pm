 Parser for Blat program

=head1 FEEDBACK

=head2 Mailing Lists

 User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
 Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to
 the Bioperl mailing list.  Your participation is much appreciated.

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.

=head2 Reporting Bugs

 Report bugs to the Bioperl bug tracking system to help us keep track
 of the bugs and their resolution. Bug reports can be submitted the
