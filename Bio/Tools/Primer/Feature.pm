=head1 NAME

Bio::Tools::Primer::Feature - position of a single primer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::Tools::Primer::Feature;

    my $pf = Bio::Tools::Primer::Feature->new( -start => $start, -end => $end, -strand => $strand);
    $pf->attach_seq($seq);

    # is a SeqFeatureI

    print "primer starts at ",$pf->start," with sequence ",$pf->seq->seq(),"\n";

    # helper functions

    print "GC percentage ",$pf->gc(),"\n";
    print "has inversion of size 4 at ",$pf->inversion(4),"\n";



=head1 DESCRIPTION

Primer Features represents one primer in a primer pair. This object is
mainly for designing primers, and probably principly used in the
primer design system
