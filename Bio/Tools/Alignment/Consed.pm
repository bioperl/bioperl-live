=head1 NAME

Bio::Tools::Alignment::Consed - A module to work with objects from consed .ace files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # a report for sequencing stuff
  my $o_consed = Bio::Tools::Alignment::Consed->new( 
      -acefile => "/path/to/an/acefile.ace.1",
      -verbose => 1);
  my $foo = $o_consed->set_reverse_designator("r");
  my $bar = $o_consed->set_forward_designator("f");

  # get the contig numbers
  my @keys = $o_consed->get_contigs();

  # construct the doublets
  my $setter_doublets = $o_consed->choose_doublets();

  # get the doublets
  my @doublets = $o_consed->get_doublets();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Bio::Tools::Alignment::Consed> provides methods and objects to deal
with the output from the Consed software suite. Specifically,
takes an C<.ace> file and provides objects for the results.

A word about doublets: This module was written to accommodate a large
EST sequencing operation. In this case, EST's were sequenced from the
3' and from the 5' end of the EST. The objective was to find a
consensus sequence for these two reads.  Thus, a contig of two is what
we wanted, and this contig should consist of the forward and reverse
reads of a getn clone. For example, for a forward designator of "F"
and a reverse designator of "R", if the two reads chad1F and chad1R
were in a single contig (for example Contig 5) it will be determined
that the consensus sequence for Contig 5 will be the sequence for
clone chad1.

Doublets are good!

This module parses C<.ace> and related files. A detailed list of methods
can be found at the end of this document.

I wrote a detailed rationale for design that may explain the reasons
why some things were done the way they were done. That document is
beyond the scope of this pod and can probably be found in the
directory from which this module was 'made' or at
L<http://www.dieselwurks.com/bioinformatics/consedpm_documentation.pdf>.

Note that the POD in that document might be old but the original
rationale still stands.

=head2 new()

 Title   : new(-acefile => $path_to_some_acefile, -verbose => "1")
 Usage   : $o_consed = Bio::Tools::Alignment::Consed->
              new(-acefile => $path_to_some_acefile, -verbose => "1");
 Function: Construct the Bio::Tools::Alignment::Consed object. Sets
	   verbosity for the following procedures, if necessary:
	   1. Construct a new Bio::Tools::Alignment::Trim object, to
	   handle quality trimming 2. Read in the acefile and parse it

 Returns : A reference to a Bio::Tools::Alignment::Consed object.
 Args    : A hash. (-acefile) is the filename of an acefile. If a full path
	   is not specified "./" is prepended to the filename and used from
	   instantiation until destruction. If you want 
           Bio::Tools::Alignment::Consed to be noisy during parsing of
           the acefile, specify some value for (-verbose).

=cut

sub new {
    my ($class,%args) = @_;

    # this is special to UNIX and should probably use catfile : DONE!
#    if (!($self->{'filename'} =~ m{/})) { 
#	$self->{'filename'} = "./".$self->{'filename'}; 
#    } 
#    $self->{'filename'} =~ m/(.*\/)(.*)ace.*$/;
#    $self->{'path'} = $1;

    # this is more generic and should work on most systems   
    (undef, $self->{'path'}, undef) = File::Spec->splitpath($self->{'filename'});

    $self->_initialize_io('-file'=>$self->{'filename'});
    $self->{'o_trim'} = Bio::Tools::Alignment::Trim->new(-verbose => $self->verbose());
    $self->set_forward_designator($DEFAULTS{'f_designator'});
    $self->set_reverse_designator($DEFAULTS{'r_designator'});

    $self->_read_file();
    return $self;
}

=head2 set_verbose()

 Title   : set_verbose()
 Usage   : $o_consed->set_verbose(1);
 Function: Set the verbosity level for debugging messages. On instantiation
	   of the Bio::Tools::Alignment::Consed object the verbosity level
           is set to 0 (quiet).
 Returns : 1 or 0.
 Args    : The verbosity levels are:
	      0 - quiet
	      1 - noisy
	      2 - noisier
	      3 - annoyingly noisy

This method for setting verbosity has largely been superseded by a
sub-by-sub way, where for every sub you can provide a (-verbose)
switch. I am doing converting this bit-by-bit so do not be surprised
if some subs do not honour this.

=head2 get_filename()

 Title   : get_filename()
 Usage   : $o_consed->get_filename();
 Function: Returns the name of the acefile being used by the
	   Bio::Tools::Alignment::Consed object.
 Returns : A scalar containing the name of a file.
 Args    : None.

=cut


sub get_filename {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{'filename'};
}

=head2 count_sequences_with_grep()

 Title   : count_sequences_with_grep()
 Usage   : $o_consed->count_sequences_with_grep();
 Function: Use /bin/grep to scan through the files in the ace project dir
	   and count sequences in those files. I used this method in the
	   development of this module to verify that I was getting all of the
	   sequences. It works, but it is (I think) unix-like platform
	   dependent.
 Returns : A scalar containing the number of sequences in the ace project
	   directory.
 Args    : None.

If you are on a non-UNIX platform, you really do not have to use
this. It is more of a debugging routine designed to address very
specific problems.

This method was reimplemented to be platform independent with a pure
perl implementation.  The above note can be ignored.

    my $self = shift;

=head2 get_path()

 Title   : get_path()
 Usage   : $o_consed->get_path();
 Function: Returns the path to the acefile this object is working with.
 Returns : Scalar. The path to the working acefile.
 Args    : None.

=head2 get_contigs()

 Title   : get_contigs()
 Usage   : $o_consed->get_contigs();
 Function: Return the keys to the Bio::Tools::Alignment::Consed object.
 Returns : An array containing the keynames in the
           Bio::Tools::Alignment::Consed object.
 Args    : None.

This would normally be used to get the keynames for some sort of
iterator. These keys are worthless in general day-to-day use because
in the Consed acefile they are simply Contig1, Contig2, ...

 Title   : get_class($contig_keyname)
 Usage   : $o_consed->get_class($contig_keyname);
 Function: Return the class name for this contig
 Returns : A scalar representing the class of this contig.
 Args    : None.
 Notes   :

sub get_class {
    my ($self,$contig) = @_;
    return $self->{contigs}->{$contig}->{class};
}

=head2 get_quality_array($contig_keyname)

 Title   : get_quality_array($contig_keyname)
 Usage   : $o_consed->get_quality_array($contig_keyname);
 Function: Returns the quality for the consensus sequence for the given
	   contig as an array. See get_quality_scalar to get this as a scalar.
 Returns : An array containing the quality for the consensus sequence with
	   the given keyname.
 Args    : The keyname of a contig. Note: This is a keyname. The key would
	   normally come from get_contigs.

Returns an array, not a reference. Is this a bug? I<thinking> No.
Well, maybe.  Why was this developed like this? I was using FreezeThaw
for object persistence, and when it froze out these arrays it took a
long time to thaw it. Much better as a scalar.

=head2 get_quality_scalar($contig_keyname)

 Title   : get_quality_scalar($contig_keyname)
 Usage   : $o_consed->get_quality_scalar($contig_keyname);
 Function: Returns the quality for the consensus sequence for the given
	   contig as a scalar. See get_quality_array to get this as an array.
 Returns : An scalar containing the quality for the consensus sequence with
           the given keyname.
 Args    : The keyname of a contig. Note this is a _keyname_. The key would
	   normally come from get_contigs.

Why was this developed like this? I was using FreezeThaw for object
persistence, and when it froze out these arrays it took a coon's age
to thaw it. Much better as a scalar.

=head2 freeze_hash()

 Title   : freeze_hash()
 Usage   : $o_consed->freeze_hash();

 Function: Use Ilya's FreezeThaw module to create a persistent data
	   object for this Bio::Tools::Alignment::Consed data
	   structure. In the case of AAFC, we use
	   Bio::Tools::Alignment::Consed to pre-process bunches of
	   sequences, freeze the structures, and send in a harvesting
	   robot later to do database stuff.
 Returns : 0 or 1;
 Args    : None.

This procedure was removed so Consed.pm won't require FreezeThaw.

 Function: Return the names of the reads in a contig. This is the name given
	   to $contig{key} based on what is in the contig. This is different
	   from the keys retrieved through get_contigs().
 Returns : An array containing the names of the reads in the contig with this

 Args    : The name of a contig. Not a key, but a name.

Highly inefficient. use some other method if possible.

 Usage   : $statistics = $o_consed->sum_lets($total_only);
 Function: Provide numbers for how many sequences were accounted for in the
           Bio::Tools::Alignment::Consed object.
 Returns : If a scalar is present, returns the total number of
           sequences accounted for in all classes. If no scalar passed
           then returns a string that looks like this:
           Singt/singn/doub/pair/mult/total : 2,0,1(2),0(0),0(0),4
           This example means the following: There were 1 singlets.
           There were 0 singletons.  There were 1 doublets for a total
           of 2 sequences in this class.  There were 0 pairs for a
           total of 0 sequences in this class.  There were 0
           multiplets for a total of 0 sequences in this class.  There
           were a total of 4 sequences accounted for in the
           Bio::Tools::Alignment::Consed object.   
 Args : A scalar is optional to change the way the numbers are returned.

Requires parse_phd() and reverse_and_complement(). I realize that it
would be much more elegant to pull qualities as required but there
were certain "features" in the acefile that required a bit more
detailed work be done to get the qualities for certain parts of the
consensus sequence. In order to make _sure_ that this was done
properly I wrote things to do all steps and then I used dump_hash()
and checked each one to ensure expected behavior. I have never changed
