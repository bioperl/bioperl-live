=head1 NAME

Bio::Annotation::AnnotationFactory - Instantiates a new 
Bio::AnnotationI (or derived class) through a factory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::Annotation::AnnotationFactory;
    # 
    my $factory = Bio::Annotation::AnnotationFactory->new(
                    -type => 'Bio::Annotation::SimpleValue');
    my $ann = $factory->create_object(-value => 'peroxisome',
                                      -tagname => 'cellular component');


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object will build L<Bio::AnnotationI> objects generically.

=head1 FEEDBACK

=head2 Mailing Lists

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to
the Bioperl mailing list.  Your participation is much appreciated.

  bioperl-l@bioperl.org                  - General discussion
  http://bioperl.org/wiki/Mailing_lists  - About the mailing lists

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.

=head2 Reporting Bugs

Report bugs to the Bioperl bug tracking system to help us keep track
of the bugs and their resolution. Bug reports can be submitted via
the web:

This is mostly copy-and-paste with subsequent adaptation from
Bio::Seq::SeqFactory by Jason Stajich. Most credits should in fact go
to him.

# Let the code begin...


package Bio::Annotation::AnnotationFactory;
use strict;


use base qw(Bio::Root::Root Bio::Factory::ObjectFactoryI);

=head2 new

 Title   : new
 Usage   : my $obj = Bio::Annotation::AnnotationFactory->new();
 Function: Builds a new Bio::Annotation::AnnotationFactory object 
 Returns : Bio::Annotation::AnnotationFactory
 Args    : -type => string, name of a L<Bio::AnnotationI> derived class.

If type is not set the module guesses it based on arguments passed to
method L<create_object>.

=cut

sub new {
    my($class,@args) = @_;

    my $self = $class->SUPER::new(@args);
  
    my ($type) = $self->_rearrange([qw(TYPE)], @args);

    $self->{'_loaded_types'} = {};
    $self->type($type) if $type;

    return $self;
}


=head2 create_object

 Title   : create_object
 Usage   : my $seq = $factory->create_object(<named parameters>);
 Function: Instantiates new Bio::AnnotationI (or one of its child classes)

           This object allows us to genericize the instantiation of
           cluster objects.

 Returns : L<Bio::AnnotationI> compliant object
           The return type is configurable using new(-type =>"...").
 Args    : initialization parameters specific to the type of annotation
           object we want.

=cut

sub create_object {
   my ($self,@args) = @_;

   my $type = $self->type; 
   if(! $type) {
       # we need to guess this
       $type = $self->_guess_type(@args);
       if(! $type) {
       $self->throw("No annotation type set and unable to guess.");
       }
       # load dynamically if it hasn't been loaded yet
       if(! $self->{'_loaded_types'}->{$type}) {
       eval {
           $self->_load_module($type);
           $self->{'_loaded_types'}->{$type} = 1;
       };
       if($@) {
           $self->throw("Bio::AnnotationI implementation $type ".
                "failed to load: ".$@);
       }
       }
   }
   return $type->new(-verbose => $self->verbose, @args);
}

=head2 type

 Title   : type
 Usage   : $obj->type($newval)
 Function: Get/set the type of L<Bio::AnnotationI> object to be created.

           This may be changed at any time during the lifetime of this
           factory.

 Returns : value of type
 Args    : newvalue (optional)

    my $self = shift;

    my $type = shift;
    if($type && (! $self->{'_loaded_types'}->{$type})) {

        };
        if( $@ ) {
        $self->throw("Annotation class '$type' failed to load: ".

    }
    return $self->{'type'} = $type;
    }
    return $self->{'type'};
}

=head2 _guess_type

 Title   : _guess_type
 Usage   :
 Function: Guesses the right type of L<Bio::AnnotationI> implementation
           based on initialization parameters for the prospective
           object.
 Example :
 Returns : the type (a string, the module name)
 Args    : initialization parameters to be passed to the prospective
           cluster object

    my ($self,@args) = @_;
