=head1 NAME

Bio::SeqFeatureI - Abstract interface of a Sequence Feature

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # get a seqfeature somehow, eg,

    foreach $feat ( $annseq->all_SeqFeatures() ) {
            print "Feature from ", $feat->start, "to ", 
	          $feat->end, " Primary tag  ", $feat->primary_tag, 
	          ", produced by ", $feat->source_tag(), "\n";

            if( $feat->strand == 0 ) {
		print "Feature applicable to either strand\n";
            } else {
                print "Feature on strand ", $feat->strand,"\n"; # -1,1
            }

            foreach $tag ( $feat->all_tags() ) {
		print "Feature has tag ", $tag, "with values, ",
		      join(' ',$feat->each_tag_value($tag)), "\n";
            }
	    print "new feature\n" if $feat->has_tag('new');
	    # features can have sub features
	    my @subfeat = $feat->sub_SeqFeature();
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This interface is the functions one can expect for any Sequence
Feature, whatever its implementation or whether it is a more complex
type (eg, a Gene). This object doesn\'t actually provide any
implemention, it just provides the definitions of what methods one can
call. See Bio::SeqFeature::Generic for a good standard implementation
of this object

 Function: Returns the source tag for a feature,
           eg, 'genscan'

   $self->throw_not_implemented();
}

=head2 has_tag

 Usage   : $tag_exists = $self->has_tag('some_tag')
 Function: 
 Returns : TRUE if the specified tag exists, and FALSE otherwise
 Args    :


=cut

sub has_tag{
   my ($self,@args) = @_;

   $self->throw_not_implemented();

}

=head2 each_tag_value

 Title   : each_tag_value
 Usage   : @values = $self->each_tag_value('some_tag')
 Function: 
 Returns : An array comprising the values of the specified tag.
 Args    :


=cut

sub each_tag_value {
   my ($self,@args) = @_;

   $self->throw_not_implemented();
}

=head2 all_tags

 Title   : all_tags
 Usage   : @tags = $feat->all_tags()
 Function: gives all tags for this feature
 Returns : an array of strings
 Args    : none

=head2 gff_string

 Title   : gff_string
 Usage   : $str = $feat->gff_string;
           $str = $feat->gff_string($gff_formatter);
 Function: Provides the feature information in GFF format.

           The implementation provided here returns GFF2 by default. If you
           want a different version, supply an object implementing a method
           gff_string() accepting a SeqFeatureI object as argument. E.g., to
           obtain GFF1 format, do the following:

                my $gffio = Bio::Tools::GFF->new(-gff_version => 1);
                $gff1str = $feat->gff_string($gff1io);

 Returns : A string
 Args    : Optionally, an object implementing gff_string().


=cut

sub gff_string{
   my ($self,$formatter) = @_;

   $formatter = $self->_static_gff_formatter unless $formatter;
   return $formatter->gff_string($self);
}

my $static_gff_formatter = undef;

=head2 _static_gff_formatter

 Title   : _static_gff_formatter
 Usage   :
 Function:
 Example :
 Returns : 
 Args    :


=cut

sub _static_gff_formatter{
   my ($self,@args) = @_;

   if( !defined $static_gff_formatter ) {
       $static_gff_formatter = Bio::Tools::GFF->new('-gff_version' => 2);
   }
   return $static_gff_formatter;
}



=head1 RangeI methods

These methods are inherited from RangeI and can be used
directly from a SeqFeatureI interface. Remember that a 
SeqFeature is-a RangeI, and so wherever you see RangeI you
can use a feature ($r in the below documentation).

=head2 overlaps

  Title   : overlaps
  Usage   : if($feat->overlaps($r)) { do stuff }
            if($feat->overlaps(200)) { do stuff }
  Function: tests if $feat overlaps $r
  Args    : a RangeI to test for overlap with, or a point
  Returns : true if the Range overlaps with the feature, false otherwise


=head2 contains

  Title   : contains
  Usage   : if($feat->contains($r) { do stuff }
  Function: tests whether $feat totally contains $r
  Args    : a RangeI to test for being contained
  Returns : true if the argument is totaly contained within this range


=head2 equals

  Title   : equals
  Usage   : if($feat->equals($r))
  Function: test whether $feat has the same start, end, strand as $r
  Args    : a RangeI to test for equality
  Returns : true if they are describing the same range


=head1 Geometrical methods

These methods do things to the geometry of ranges, and return
triplets (start, stop, strand) from which new ranges could be built.

=head2 intersection

  Title   : intersection
  Usage   : ($start, $stop, $strand) = $feat->intersection($r)
  Function: gives the range that is contained by both ranges
  Args    : a RangeI to compare this one to
  Returns : nothing if they do not overlap, or the range that they do overlap

=head2 union

  Title   : union
  Usage   : ($start, $stop, $strand) = $feat->union($r);
          : ($start, $stop, $strand) = Bio::RangeI->union(@ranges);
  Function: finds the minimal range that contains all of the ranges
  Args    : a range or list of ranges to find the union of
  Returns : the range containing all of the ranges

=cut

=head2 location

 Title   : location
 Usage   : my $location = $seqfeature->location()
 Function: returns a location object suitable for identifying location 
	   of feature on sequence or parent feature  
 Returns : Bio::LocationI object
 Args    : none


=cut

sub location {
   my ($self) = @_;

   $self->throw_not_implemented();
}
