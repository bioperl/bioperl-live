 Function: Returns the trace values as a reference to an array containing the
     trace values. The individual elements of the trace array are not validated
     and can be any numeric value.
 Returns : A reference to an array.
 Status  : 
Arguments: $base : which color channel would you like the trace values for?
               - $base must be one of "A","T","G","C"

 Args    : If used, the trace indices will be set to the provided value.

=head2 _reset_peak_indices()

 Title   : _rest_peak_indices()
 Usage   : $obj->_reset_peak_indices();
 Function: Reset the peak indices.
 Returns : Nothing.
 Args    : None.
 Notes   : When you create a sub_trace_object, the peak indices
     will still be pointing to the apporpriate location _in the
     original trace_. In order to fix this, the initial value must
     be subtracted from each value here. ie. The first peak index
     must be "1".

 Returns : A scalar
 Args    : If used, the trace index at this position will be 
     set to the provided value.

=head2 alphabet()

 Title   : alphabet();
 Usage   : $molecule_type = $obj->alphabet();
 Function: Get the molecule type from the PrimarySeq object.
 Returns : What what PrimarySeq says the type of the sequence is.
 Args    : None.

=cut

	my $self = shift;
	return $self->{swq}->alphabet;

=head2 display_id()

 Title   : display_id()
 Usage   : $id_string = $obj->display_id();
 Function: Returns the display id, aka the common name of the Quality
        object.
        The semantics of this is that it is the most likely string to be
        used as an identifier of the quality sequence, and likely to have
        "human" readability.  The id is equivalent to the ID field of the
        GenBank/EMBL databanks and the id field of the Swissprot/sptrembl
        database. In fasta format, the >(\S+) is presumed to be the id,
        though some people overload the id to embed other information.
        Bioperl does not use any embedded information in the ID field,
        and people are encouraged to use other mechanisms (accession
	field for example, or extending the sequence object) to solve
	this. Notice that $seq->id() maps to this function, mainly for
        legacy/convience issues.
	This method sets the display_id for the Quality object.
 Returns : A string
 Args    : If a scalar is provided, it is set as the new display_id for
	the Quality object.
 Status  : Virtual

=cut

sub display_id {
   my ($self,$value) = @_;
   if( defined $value) {
      $self->{swq}->display_id($value);
    }
    return $self->{swq}->display_id();

}

=head2 accession_number()

 Title   : accession_number()
 Usage   : $unique_biological_key = $obj->accession_number();
 Function: Returns the unique biological id for a sequence, commonly
        called the accession_number. For sequences from established
        databases, the implementors should try to use the correct
        accession number. Notice that primary_id() provides the unique id
        for the implemetation, allowing multiple objects to have the same
        accession number in a particular implementation. For sequences
        with no accession number, this method should return "unknown".
	This method sets the accession_number for the Quality
	object. 
 Returns : A string (the value of accession_number)
 Args    : If a scalar is provided, it is set as the new accession_number
	for the Quality object.
 Status  : Virtual


=cut

sub accession_number {
    my( $self, $acc ) = @_;
    if (defined $acc) {
        $self->{swq}->accession_number($acc);
    } else {
        $acc = $self->{swq}->accession_number();
        $acc = 'unknown' unless defined $acc;
    }
    return $acc;
}

=head2 primary_id()

 Title   : primary_id()
 Usage   : $unique_implementation_key = $obj->primary_id();
 Function: Returns the unique id for this object in this implementation.
        This allows implementations to manage their own object ids in a
        way the implementaiton can control clients can expect one id to
        map to one object. For sequences with no accession number, this
        method should return a stringified memory location.
	This method sets the primary_id for the Quality
	object.
 Returns : A string. (the value of primary_id)
 Args    : If a scalar is provided, it is set as the new primary_id for
	the Quality object.

=cut

sub primary_id {
   my ($self,$value) = @_;
   if ($value) {
      $self->{swq}->primary_id($value);
    }
   return $self->{swq}->primary_id();

}

=head2 desc()

 Title   : desc()
 Usage   : $qual->desc($newval); _or_ 
           $description = $qual->desc();
 Function: Get/set description text for this Quality object.
 Returns : A string. (the value of desc)
 Args    : If a scalar is provided, it is set as the new desc for the
	   Quality object.

=cut

sub desc {
	# a mechanism to set the desc for the Quality object.
	# probably will be used most often by set_common_features()
   my ($self,$value) = @_;
   if( defined $value) {
      $self->{swq}->desc($value);
    }
      return $self->{swq}->desc();
}

=head2 id()

 Title   : id()
 Usage   : $id = $qual->id();
 Function: Return the ID of the quality. This should normally be (and
        actually is in the implementation provided here) just a synonym
        for display_id().
 Returns : A string. (the value of id)
 Args    : If a scalar is provided, it is set as the new id for the
	   Quality object.

=cut

sub id {
   my ($self,$value) = @_;
   if (!$self) { $self->throw("no value for self in $value"); }
   if( defined $value ) {
       $self->{swq}->display_id($value);
   }
   return $self->{swq}->display_id();
}

=head2 seq

 Title   : seq()
 Usage   : $string    = $obj->seq(); _or_
	$obj->seq("atctatcatca");
 Function: Returns the sequence that is contained in the imbedded in the
	PrimarySeq object within the Quality object
 Returns : A scalar (the seq() value for the imbedded PrimarySeq object.)
 Args    : If a scalar is provided, the Quality object will
	attempt to set that as the sequence for the imbedded PrimarySeq
	object. Otherwise, the value of seq() for the PrimarySeq object
	is returned.
 Notes   : This is probably not a good idea because you then should call
	length() to make sure that the sequence and quality are of the
	same length. Even then, how can you make sure that this sequence
	belongs with that quality? I provided this to give you rope to
	hang yourself with. Tie it to a strong device and use a good
	knot.

=cut

=head2 qual()

 Title   : qual()
 Usage   : @quality_values  = @{$obj->qual()}; _or_
	$obj->qual("10 10 20 40 50");
 Function: Returns the quality as imbedded in the PrimaryQual object
	within the Quality object.
 Returns : A reference to an array containing the quality values in the 
	PrimaryQual object.
 Args    : If a scalar is provided, the Quality object will
	attempt to set that as the quality for the imbedded PrimaryQual
	object. Otherwise, the value of qual() for the PrimaryQual
	object is returned.
 Notes   : This is probably not a good idea because you then should call
	length() to make sure that the sequence and quality are of the
	same length. Even then, how can you make sure that this sequence
	belongs with that quality? I provided this to give you a strong

=head2 sub_trace_object($start,$end)

 Title   : sub_trace_object($start,$end)
 Usage   : $smaller_object = $object->sub_trace_object('1','100');
 Function: Get a subset of the sequence, its quality, and its trace.
 Returns : A reference to a Bio::Seq::SequenceTrace object
 Args    : a start position and an end position
 Notes   : 
     - the start and end position refer to the positions of _bases_.
     - for example, to get a sub SequenceTrace for bases 5-10,
          use this routine.
          - you will get the bases, qualities, and the trace values
          - you can then use this object to synthesize a new scf
               using seqIO::scf.

 Function: Used in debugging. Prints all traces one beside each other.
 Returns : Nothing.
 Args    : References to the arrays containing the traces for A,C,G,T.
 Notes   : Beats using dumpValue, I'll tell ya. Much better then using

     - if a scalar is included as an argument (any scalar), this
     procedure will dump the _delta'd trace. If you don't know what
     that means you should not be using this.
