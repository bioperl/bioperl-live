=head1 NAME

Bio::Seq::SeqWithQuality - Bioperl object packaging a sequence with its quality.
Deprecated class, use Bio::Seq::Quality instead!

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::PrimarySeq;
    use Bio::Seq::PrimaryQual;
    use Bio::Seq::SeqWithQuality;

    # make from memory
    my $qual = Bio::Seq::SeqWithQuality->new
    ( -qual => '10 20 30 40 50 50 20 10',
      -seq => 'ATCGATCG',
      -id  => 'human_id',
      -accession_number => 'AL000012',
    );

    # make from objects
    # first, make a PrimarySeq object
    my $seqobj = Bio::PrimarySeq->new
    ( -seq => 'atcgatcg',
      -id  => 'GeneFragment-12',
      -accession_number => 'X78121',
      -alphabet => 'dna'
    );

    # now make a PrimaryQual object
    my $qualobj = Bio::Seq::PrimaryQual->new
    ( -qual => '10 20 30 40 50 50 20 10',
      -id  => 'GeneFragment-12',
      -accession_number => 'X78121',
      -alphabet => 'dna'
    );

    # now make the SeqWithQuality object
    my $swqobj = Bio::Seq::SeqWithQuality->new
    ( -seq  => $seqobj,
      -qual => $qualobj
    );
    # done!

    $swqobj->id(); # the id of the SeqWithQuality object
    # may not match the the id of the sequence or
    # of the quality (check the pod, luke)
    $swqobj->seq(); # the sequence of the SeqWithQuality object
    $swqobj->qual(); # the quality of the SeqWithQuality object

    # to get out parts of the sequence.

    print "Sequence ", $seqobj->id(), " with accession ",
    $seqobj->accession, " and desc ", $seqobj->desc, "\n";

    $string2 = $seqobj->subseq(1,40);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object stores base quality values together with the sequence string.

 Title   : new()
 Usage   : $qual = Bio::Seq::SeqWithQuality ->new
             ( -qual => '10 20 30 40 50 50 20 10',
               -seq => 'ATCGATCG',
               -id  => 'human_id',
               -accession_number => 'AL000012',
               -trace_indices    => '0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35'
             );
 Function: Returns a new Bio::Seq::SeqWithQual object from basic
           constructors.
 Returns : a new Bio::Seq::PrimaryQual object
 Args    : -qual can be a quality string (see Bio::Seq::PrimaryQual for more
            information on this) or a reference to a Bio::Seq::PrimaryQual
            object.
           -seq can be a sequence string (see Bio::PrimarySeq for more
            information on this) or a reference to a Bio::PrimaryQual object.
           -seq, -id, -accession_number, -primary_id, -desc, -id behave like
            this:
             1. if they are provided on construction of the
                 Bio::Seq::SeqWithQuality they will be set as the descriptors for
                 the object unless changed by one of the following mechanisms:
              a) $obj->set_common_descriptors() is used and both the -seq and
                 the -qual object have the same descriptors. These common
                 descriptors will then become the descriptors for the
                 Bio::Seq::SeqWithQual object.
              b) the descriptors are manually set using the seq(), id(),
                 desc(), or accession_number(), primary_id(),
             2. if no descriptors are provided, the new() constructor will see
                if the descriptor used in the PrimarySeq and in the
                PrimaryQual objects match. If they do, they will become
                the descriptors for the SeqWithQuality object.
             To eliminate ambiguity, I strongly suggest you set the
             descriptors manually on construction of the object. Really.
           -trace_indices : a space_delimited list of trace indices
            (where would the peaks be drawn if this list of qualities
            was to be plotted?)

=head2 display_id()

 Title   : display_id()
 Usage   : $id_string = $obj->display_id();
 Function: Returns the display id, aka the common name of the Quality object.
           The semantics of this is that it is the most likely string to be
           used as an identifier of the quality sequence, and likely to have
           "human" readability.  The id is equivalent to the ID field of the
           GenBank/EMBL databanks and the id field of the Swissprot/sptrembl
           database. In fasta format, the >(\S+) is presumed to be the id,
           though some people overload the id to embed other information.
           Bioperl does not use any embedded information in the ID field,
           and people are encouraged to use other mechanisms (accession
           field for example, or extending the sequence object) to solve
           this. Notice that $seq->id() maps to this function, mainly for
           legacy/convience issues.
           This method sets the display_id for the SeqWithQuality object.
 Returns : A string
 Args    : If a scalar is provided, it is set as the new display_id for
           the SeqWithQuality object.
 Status  : Virtual

=cut

sub display_id {
   my ($obj,$value) = @_;
   if( defined $value) {
      $obj->{'display_id'} = $value;
    }
    return $obj->{'display_id'};

}

=head2 accession_number()

 Title   : accession_number()
 Usage   : $unique_biological_key = $obj->accession_number();
 Function: Returns the unique biological id for a sequence, commonly
           called the accession_number. For sequences from established
           databases, the implementors should try to use the correct
           accession number. Notice that primary_id() provides the unique id
           for the implemetation, allowing multiple objects to have the same
           accession number in a particular implementation. For sequences
           with no accession number, this method should return "unknown".
           This method sets the accession_number for the SeqWithQuality
           object. 
 Returns : A string (the value of accession_number)
 Args    : If a scalar is provided, it is set as the new accession_number
           for the SeqWithQuality object.
 Status  : Virtual

=cut

sub accession_number {
    my( $obj, $acc ) = @_;

    if (defined $acc) {
        $obj->{'accession_number'} = $acc;
    } else {
        $acc = $obj->{'accession_number'};
        $acc = 'unknown' unless defined $acc;
    }
    return $acc;
}

=head2 primary_id()

 Title   : primary_id()
 Usage   : $unique_implementation_key = $obj->primary_id();
 Function: Returns the unique id for this object in this implementation.
           This allows implementations to manage their own object ids in a
           way the implementaiton can control clients can expect one id to
           map to one object. For sequences with no accession number, this
           method should return a stringified memory location.
           This method sets the primary_id for the SeqWithQuality object.
 Returns : A string. (the value of primary_id)
 Args    : If a scalar is provided, it is set as the new primary_id for
           the SeqWithQuality object.

=cut

sub primary_id {
   my ($obj,$value) = @_;
   if ($value) {
      $obj->{'primary_id'} = $value;
    }
   return $obj->{'primary_id'};

}

=head2 desc()

 Title   : desc()
 Usage   : $qual->desc($newval); _or_ 
           $description = $qual->desc();
 Function: Get/set description text for this SeqWithQuality object.
 Returns : A string. (the value of desc)
 Args    : If a scalar is provided, it is set as the new desc for the
           SeqWithQuality object.

=cut

sub desc {
   # a mechanism to set the disc for the SeqWithQuality object.
   # probably will be used most often by set_common_features()
   my ($obj,$value) = @_;
   if( defined $value) {
      $obj->{'desc'} = $value;
   }
   return $obj->{'desc'};
}

=head2 id()

 Title   : id()
 Usage   : $id = $qual->id();
 Function: Return the ID of the quality. This should normally be (and
           actually is in the implementation provided here) just a synonym
           for display_id().
 Returns : A string. (the value of id)
 Args    : If a scalar is provided, it is set as the new id for the
           SeqWithQuality object.

=cut

sub id {
   my ($self,$value) = @_;
   if (!$self) { $self->throw("no value for self in $value"); }
   if( defined $value ) {
      return $self->display_id($value);
   }
   return $self->display_id();
}

=head2 seq

 Title   : seq()
 Usage   : $string    = $obj->seq(); _or_ $obj->seq("atctatcatca");
 Function: Returns the sequence that is contained in the imbedded in the
           PrimarySeq object within the SeqWithQuality object
 Returns : A scalar (the seq() value for the imbedded PrimarySeq object.)
 Args    : If a scalar is provided, the SeqWithQuality object will
           attempt to set that as the sequence for the imbedded PrimarySeq
           object. Otherwise, the value of seq() for the PrimarySeq object
           is returned.
 Notes   : This is probably not a good idea because you then should call
           length() to make sure that the sequence and quality are of the
           same length. Even then, how can you make sure that this sequence
           belongs with that quality? I provided this to give you rope to
           hang yourself with. Tie it to a strong device and use a good
           knot.

=cut

sub seq {
   my ($self,$value) = @_;
   if( defined $value) {
      $self->{seq_ref}->seq($value);
      $self->length();
   }
   return $self->{seq_ref}->seq();
}

=head2 qual()

 Title   : qual()
 Usage   : @quality_values  = @{$obj->qual()}; _or_
           $obj->qual("10 10 20 40 50");
 Function: Returns the quality as imbedded in the PrimaryQual object
           within the SeqWithQuality object.
 Returns : A reference to an array containing the quality values in the 
           PrimaryQual object.
 Args    : If a scalar is provided, the SeqWithQuality object will
           attempt to set that as the quality for the imbedded PrimaryQual
           object. Otherwise, the value of qual() for the PrimaryQual

 Notes   : This is probably not a good idea because you then should call
           length() to make sure that the sequence and quality are of the
           same length. Even then, how can you make sure that this sequence
           belongs with that quality? I provided this to give you a strong
           board with which to flagellate yourself.
