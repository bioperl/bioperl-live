=head1 NAME

Bio::DB::Ace - Database object interface to ACeDB servers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $db = Bio::DB::Ace->new( -server => 'myace.server.com', port => '120000');

    $seq = $db->get_Seq_by_id('MUSIGHBA1'); # Unique ID

    # or ...

    $seq = $db->get_Seq_by_acc('J00522'); # Accession Number

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This provides a standard BioPerl database access to Ace, using Lincoln Steins
excellent AcePerl module. You need to download and install the aceperl module from

  http://stein.cshl.org/AcePerl/

before this interface will work.

This interface is designed at the moment to work through a aceclient/aceserver
type mechanism

=head1 INSTALLING ACEPERL

Download the latest aceperl tar file, gunzip/untar and cd into the directory.
This is a standard CPAN-style directory, so if you go

  Perl Makefile.PL
  make
  <become root>
  make install

Then you will have installed Aceperl. Use the PREFIX mechanism to install elsewhere.

=head1 FEEDBACK

=head2 Mailing Lists

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this
and other Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably
 to one of the Bioperl mailing lists.
Your participation is much appreciated.

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.

=head2 Reporting Bugs

Report bugs to the Bioperl bug tracking system to help us keep track
the bugs and their resolution.  Bug reports can be submitted via the
web:
