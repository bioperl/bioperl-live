=head1 NAME

Bio::Ontology::OntologyEngineI - Interface a minimal Ontology implementation should satisfy

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # see documentation of methods

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This describes the minimal interface an ontology query engine should
provide.  It intentionally does not make explicit references to the
ontology being a DAG, nor does it mandate that the ontology be a
vocabulary. Rather, it tries to generically express what should be
accessible (queriable) about an ontology.

The idea is to allow for different implementations for different
purposes, which may then differ as to which operations are efficient
and which are not, and how much richer the functionality is on top of
this minimalistic set of methods. Check modules in the Bio::Ontology
namespace to find out which implementations exist. At the time of
writing, there is a SimpleOntologyEngine (which does not use
Graph.pm), and a Graph.pm-based implementation in SimpleGOEngine.

Ontology parsers in Bio::OntologyIO are required to return an
implementation of this interface.

=head1 FEEDBACK

=head2 Mailing Lists

User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to
the Bioperl mailing list.  Your participation is much appreciated.

=head2 Support 

Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

I<bioperl-l@bioperl.org>

rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and 
reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly 
address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem 
with code and data examples if at all possible.

=head2 Reporting Bugs

Report bugs to the Bioperl bug tracking system to help us keep track
of the bugs and their resolution. Bug reports can be submitted via
the web:

 Title   : relationship_factory
 Usage   : $fact = $obj->relationship_factory()

           compliant object)
 Args    : 

=cut

sub term_factory{
    return shift->throw_not_implemented();
}

=head1 Decorator Methods

 These methods come with a default implementation that uses the
 abstract methods defined for this interface. This may not be very
 efficient, and hence implementors are encouraged to override these
 methods if they can provide more efficient implementations.

=cut

=head2 get_all_terms

 Title   : get_all_terms
 Usage   : get_all_terms: TermI
 Function: Retrieves all terms from the ontology.

           This is more a decorator method. We provide a default
           implementation here that loops over all root terms and gets
           all descendants for each root term. The overall union of
           terms is then made unique by name and ontology.

           We do not mandate an order here in which the terms are
           returned. In fact, the default implementation will return
           them in unpredictable order.

           Engine implementations that can provide a more efficient
           method for obtaining all terms should definitely override
           this.

 Example : @terms = $obj->get_all_terms()
 Returns : Array of TermI objects.
 Args    :

=cut

sub get_all_terms{
    my $self = shift;
    # get all root nodes
    my @roots = $self->get_root_terms();
    # accumulate all descendants for each root term
    my @terms = map { $self->get_descendant_terms($_); } @roots;
    # add on the root terms themselves
    push(@terms, @roots);
    # make unique by name and ontology
    my %name_map = map { ($_->name."@".$_->ontology->name, $_); } @terms;
    # done 
    return values %name_map;
}

=head2 find_terms

 Title   : find_terms
 Usage   : ($term) = $oe->find_terms(-identifier => "SO:0000263");
 Function: Find term instances matching queries for their attributes.

           An implementation may not support querying for arbitrary
           attributes, but can generally be expected to accept
           -identifier and -name as queries. If both are provided,
           they are implicitly intersected.

 Example :
 Returns : an array of zero or more Bio::Ontology::TermI objects
 Args    : Named parameters. The following parameters should be recognized
           by any implementation:

              -identifier    query by the given identifier
              -name          query by the given name

=cut

sub find_terms{
    my $self = shift;
    my %params = @_;
    @params{ map { lc $_; } keys %params } = values %params; # lowercase keys

    my @terms = grep {
	my $ok = exists($params{-identifier}) ?
	    $_->identifier() eq $params{-identifier} : 1;
	$ok && ((! exists($params{-name})) ||
		($_->name() eq $params{-name}));
    } $self->get_all_terms();
    return @terms;
}

=head1 Experimental API method proposals

 Ontologies are a very new domain in bioperl, and we are not sure yet
 what we will want to do on and with ontologies in which
 situation. The methods from here on downwards are solely API
 descriptions to solicit comment and feedback; the chance of any of
 those being actually implemented already is very slim.

 Disclaimer: As long as an API method stays in this section, it is
 subject to change, possibly even radical change or complete
 deletion. If it's not implemented yet (most likely it isn't),
 implement yourself at your own risk.

 So far for the disclaimer. The reason the API description is here,
 however, is to solicit feedback. Please feel encouraged to share your
 opinion, regardless of what it is (a notable difference of this API
 method to others is that there is actually no working code behind it
 - so the defense line is non-existent for practical purposes).

=head2 common_ancestor_path

 Title   : common_ancestor_path
 Usage   :
 Function: Get the paths from two terms A and B to term C, such that
           there is no other term D to which A and B would have a shorter
           path, provided there is a term C to which both A and B are
           connected by a path.

           Note that the path to the common ancestor between A and A
           exists, has distance zero, and predicate "identity".

           The search for the common ancestor C can be further
           constrained by supplying a predicate term. If supplied, the
           predicates of the two paths (A,C) and (B,C) must have a
           common ancestor identical to the predicate, or that has a
           path to the predicate.

 Example :
 Returns : The path of the first term to the common ancestor in scalar
           context, and both paths in list context. Paths are
           Bio::Ontology::PathI compliant objects.
 Args    : The two terms (Bio::Ontology::TermI objects), and optionally
           a constraining common predicate (Bio::Ontology::TermI object).
           The latter may also be given as a scalar, in which case it
           is treated as a boolean that, if TRUE, means that the two paths
           must have identical predicates in order to be returned.
