Bio::Factory::ObjectFactoryI - A General object creator factory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

# see the implementations of this interface for details but
# basically

    my $obj = $factory->create(%args);

and initialize whatever new object the implementing class is designed for.

=head2 create

 Title   : create
 Usage   : $factory->create(%args)
 Function: Create a new object  
 Returns : a new object
 Args    : hash of initialization parameters


=cut

sub create{
   my ($self,@args) = @_;
   $self->throw_not_implemented();
}

=head2 create_object

 Title   : create_object
 Usage   : $obj = $factory->create_object(%args)
 Function: Create a new object.

           This is supposed to supercede create(). Right now it only delegates
           to create().
 Returns : a new object
 Args    : hash of initialization parameters


=cut

sub create_object{
   my ($self,@args) = @_;
   return $self->create(@args);
}
