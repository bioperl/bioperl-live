=head1 NAME

symlink_script.pl - install script to create symbolic links

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  perl Build.pl
  ./Build install

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Used during "./Build install". Only works if the script installation directory
used during "perl Build.pl" matches that used for the actual installation during
"./Build install". So if you install to a special place, do

  perl Build.pl --install_base /home/me
  ./Build install

not

  perl Build.pl
  ./Build install --install_base /home/me

This script will create a symlink to a script in that same directory. It was
written to create a symlink with the name 'bp_pg_bulk_load_gff.pl' that targeted
'bp_bulk_load_gff.pl' but can be extended by adding files to the
%symlink_scripts hash.

Perl function 'symlink' is used to keep the script from crashing on systems
that don't allow symbolic linking.
