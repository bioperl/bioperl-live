<h2>What is the BioPerl Deobfuscator?</h2>
<p>The Deobfuscator was written to make it easier to determine the methods that
are available from a given BioPerl module.</p>
<p>BioPerl is a highly object-oriented software package, with often multiple
levels of inheritance. Although each individual module is usually well 
documented for the methods specific to it, identifying the inherited methods
is less straightforward.</p>
<p>The Deobfuscator indexes all of the BioPerl POD documentation, taking account
of the inheritance tree, and then presents all of the methods available to
each module through a searchable web interface.</p>
<p>The following diagram lays out what each part of the Deobfuscator does, and how the pieces interact. For more details, see the POD documentation for Deobfuscator.pm, deob_interface.cgi, and deob_index.pl.
