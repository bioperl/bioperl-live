=head1 NAME

seqretsplit - split a sequence (or stream) into a single file per sequence

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  seqretsplit file1 file2 .. 
  # or
  seqretsplit < file1 

=head1 DESCRIPTION 

The script will split all sequences from fasta file(s) (or stdin) to
individual files. The filename is the sequence ID (everything before
the 1st whitespace in a FASTA header).  Currently it doesn't check to
see that it isn't overwriting an existing file so IDs should be unique

This is inspired by EMBOSS seqretsplit tool.
