=head1 NAME

bp_seq_length.pl - lists the number of bases and number of sequences in specified sequence database files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

bp_seq_length.pl *.fa

=head1 DESCRIPTION

bp_seq_length.pl will report the total number of residues and total number of individual sequences contained within a specified sequence database file.

=head1 OPTIONS

 -f/--format          - Specify the database format ('fasta' is default).
                        This script uses SeqIO and as such formats are 
                        limited to those which SeqIO system supports.
